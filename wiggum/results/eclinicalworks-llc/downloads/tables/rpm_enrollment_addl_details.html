Values 0 This means that the patient has all the devices in Prescribed status only. No device is Activated. 

1 - This means that the patient has all the devices in Activated status. No Device is in Prescribed status.

2 - This means that the patient has some devices in Prescribed status and some devices in Activated Status. Hence, we need to display the patient in both RPM Queues Enrollment Queue and Enrolled Patients Queue.

4 - This means there are patients who have deleted the prescribed devices and are currently in eligible queue.

The data type chosen is TINYINT as this field can have only three values 0, 1 and 2.</td>
