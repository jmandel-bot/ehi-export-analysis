  "fhir_vs_ehi_notes": "Epic's EHI export is fundamentally different from their FHIR APIs. The EHI export dumps Epic's actual database tables in TSV format - raw, unmapped, comprehensive. This includes local codes, custom fields, internal identifiers, billing details, audit trails, and operational data that would never surface through FHIR US Core APIs. While Epic also offers excellent FHIR support, this EHI export provides the complete picture of what's actually stored in Epic's database, making it the only practical way to access comprehensive billing, insurance, custom form data, and historical information that predates or wasn't mapped for FHIR.",
  "summary": "Epic Systems Corporation provides the gold standard for EHI export documentation. Their public website at open.epic.com/EHITables offers comprehensive documentation for 7,673 database tables representing Epic's complete EHI export schema. Each table is documented at the field level with data types, descriptions, and enumerated values. The export format is TSV (tab-separated values) native to Epic's database. The documentation is easily accessible, downloadable as a 12.7 MB ZIP file, current (February 2026), and requires no login or navigation complexity. This documentation far exceeds ONC requirements and represents the most thorough EHI export documentation available from any major EHR vendor."
