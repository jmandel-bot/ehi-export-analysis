    "No field-level documentation: maps EHR concepts to FHIR resource types but does not document individual fields, data types, or value sets. Relies on standard FHIR R4 resource definitions.",
    "Hospital platform lacks explicit Insurance/Coverage mapping — ambulatory has it.",
    "No audit trail data in export — Provenance resource exists in the platform but is not included in EHI export mappings.",
    "No sample export files or test data available.",
    "Population export requires contacting support ('users requiring a patient population export must contact support to initiate the request')."

  "summary": "Azalea Health exports EHI as FHIR R4 NDJSON files via Bulk Data Export API. The ambulatory platform maps 57 EHR concepts to 30 FHIR resource types; the hospital platform maps 45 concepts to 24 resource types (34 unique across both). Coverage is strong for clinical data, billing (Claim, Account, Invoice, PaymentReconciliation), portal messages (Communication), appointments, and documents/images (including base64-encoded Binary resources). Insurance coverage is only in ambulatory. Audit trails are not exported. Documentation is concept-level mapping tables — no field-level schema is provided beyond standard FHIR R4 definitions."
