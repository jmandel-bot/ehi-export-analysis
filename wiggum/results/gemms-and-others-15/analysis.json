  "summary": "MedInformatix provides comprehensive EHI export documentation on a single public HTML page covering three export formats: C-CDA R2.1 for clinical data (USCDI V1), 27 CSV files for discrete data (PM, EMR, audit, QPP), and a document repository for original-format files. The CSV documentation includes field-level descriptions and sample records for all 27 tables (~601 total fields), covering clinical data, billing/claims, payments, insurance authorizations, appointments, messages, audit trails, and documents. This is a genuine database-level export, not a FHIR re-export — tables like CLCLAIM, PAYMENTS, BALANCE, CLAUTHRZ, and CLACTIVITYLOG expose PM and audit data that would not be available through FHIR APIs."
