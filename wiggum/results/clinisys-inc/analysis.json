  "issues": [
    "Documentation covers only lab results export (HL7 ORU^R01), not a comprehensive database dump of all system data",
    "Export container/packaging method not described — unclear how bulk export is delivered (individual HL7 messages? batch file? ZIP?)",
    "No insurance (IN1) segment included in export despite PV1 having Financial Class field",
    "No audit trail data included in export despite system being certified for 170.315(d)(2) Auditable Events",
    "Documentation titles say 'Results Export' not 'EHI Export' — scope may be narrower than full Designated Record Set",
    "Both PDFs carry confidentiality notices restricting distribution to clients and their vendors — potentially inconsistent with ONC's public accessibility requirement"
  ],
  "summary": "Clinisys (formerly Orchard Software) provides two PDFs documenting their EHI export format for their lab information systems (Harvest and Enterprise). The export uses HL7 v2.3 ORU^R01 messages containing patient demographics, lab orders, and observation results with field-level detail including LOINC mapping. As a laboratory-only system, the scope is inherently narrower than a full EHR — covering lab results, orders, specimens, and patient demographics but lacking billing details, insurance, messaging, appointments, or audit trails. The documentation is well-structured with segment/field tables but is titled 'Results Export' rather than 'EHI Export', raising questions about whether it represents the complete Designated Record Set."
