  "summary": "Darena Health (formerly MeldRx) is a FHIR middleware platform used by 11 different EHR vendors for ONC certification. The b(10) EHI export uses FHIR Bulk Data $export across 24 standard FHIR resource types (clinical data plus Coverage and DocumentReference), with non-FHIR resources exported as DocumentReference wrappers. The export documentation is minimal — just two paragraphs on the ONC certification page linking to (now-dead) swagger docs and a FHIR Bulk Data spec, supplemented by a Postman API documentation site at docs.darena.health. There is no data dictionary, no field-level documentation, and several important EHI domains (billing, scheduling, messaging, audit trails) appear absent from the supported resource types. The DH Schema sample request body on the Postman docs provides example JSON structures showing a proprietary-to-FHIR mapping format."
