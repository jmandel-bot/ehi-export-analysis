The ZIP also includes a ReadMe with links to the format specifications. This is a laboratory information system — the export covers lab results, microbiology, blood bank, pathology, genetics, and billing. It does NOT cover general EHR domains like appointments, secure messages, or problem lists because SCC is a LIMS, not a full EHR."

    "SCC is a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), not a general-purpose EHR. The EHI export only covers data domains relevant to laboratory operations: clinical lab results, microbiology, blood bank, pathology, genetics, and lab billing. It inherently cannot export data it doesn't manage (appointments, medications, problem lists, secure messages, etc.).",
    "Bulk/population export requires contacting SCC services — it is not self-service. Single-patient export is self-service via EhiExportConsole.",
    "Billing export only includes charges processed through SoftBill/SoftAR. Charges sent to external billing systems are explicitly excluded.",
    "Document export from SoftMedia only includes files linked at the test/procedure/component level — documents linked to patient, stay, or order records are NOT exported.",
    "The 4.0 and 4.5 documents are versioned separately for different software releases but follow the same structure and format."
  ],
  "summary": "SCC Soft Computer provides well-documented EHI export specifications for their SoftLab LIMS suite. The export produces a ZIP containing HL7 v2.5.1 messages (lab results across clinical chemistry, microbiology, blood bank, pathology, and genetics), XML billing history (charges, payments, transactions with CPT/ICD-10 codes), and linked documents from SoftMedia. Documentation is thorough at the field level with data types, cardinality, and business rules for each HL7 segment. However, as a laboratory system, the export scope is inherently narrow compared to a full EHR — no medications, problem lists, appointments, or secure messages exist in the system to export."
