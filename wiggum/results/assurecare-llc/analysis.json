    "No data dictionary or field-level documentation provided",
    "No description of what specific data domains are included in the export beyond 'C-CDA' and 'FHIR'",
    "Export appears to be C-CDA + FHIR Bulk Data rather than a raw database dump — likely missing billing, insurance, messages, audit trails, and other non-clinical data",
    "Document states it is 'intended for use of iPatientCare clients only' despite being publicly accessible",
    "Last updated February 2023 — may be outdated",
    "No mention of how much data beyond USCDI v1 / US Core STU 3.1.1 is included — likely not 'all EHI' as required by b(10)"
  ],
  "summary": "AssureCare LLC provides a minimal 3-page PDF documenting their EHI export for iPatientCare. The export uses C-CDA XML and FHIR R4 Bulk Data formats, which are standardized clinical data formats rather than raw database exports. No data dictionary, field-level detail, or explicit coverage of non-clinical data (billing, insurance, messages, audit trails) is documented, raising questions about whether the export truly captures 'all EHI' as required by 170.315(b)(10)."
