    "No audit trail/access log data class despite this being part of the Designated Record Set",

  "summary": "CareTracker's Amazing Charts provides a concise 8-page PDF documenting 44 data classes exported as CSV/JSON/XML files in per-patient folders. The documentation lists column headings for each data class but lacks data types, value sets, or schema definitions. Coverage is reasonably broad — clinical notes, billing with CPT/ICD codes and charges, insurance, scheduling, medications, labs, immunizations, documents/images, and email/messaging are all present. Notable gaps include no audit trail and no sample data."
