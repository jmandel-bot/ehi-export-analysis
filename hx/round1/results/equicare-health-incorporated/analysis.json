  ],
  "summary": "Equicare Health provides a single-page HTML specification for their JSON-based EHI export covering 17 data categories focused on cancer care coordination (navigation, treatment summaries, survivorship plans, questionnaires). The export includes secure messages, appointments, clinical data, CCDAs, and Base64-encoded attachments. Notable gaps: no billing/financial data, no detailed insurance, and no audit trails — though some of these may reflect the system's specialty scope (cancer navigation, not full EHR). The inline JSON example is a helpful touch, but field-level documentation lacks data types, descriptions, and value sets for individual fields."
