            <h1>Electronic Health Information Export</h1>

            <p>Electronic Health Information (EHI) refers to patient data stored in electronic formats that are collected and shared for direct healthcare services. EHI Export is the export of the data in patients' charts and accounts at a health organization provided in a machine-readable format. The ability to export EHI is built into Greenway's electronic health record (EHR) and practice management (PM) products. EHI Export is a requirement for the Office of the National Coordinator's Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) 21st Century Cures Edition program. EHI Export supports two modes:</p>
			
			<ul>
                <li><b>Single Patient</b> allows the export of EHI for a patient. It typically satisfies a request by a patient or their authorized representative and enables them to access their data.</li>
                <li><b>Patient Population</b> allows the export of EHI for all patients in a health organization. It is typically used by Health IT systems.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>This website details the content and format of the EHI Export for anyone who will be using EHI from Greenway software. The following considerations may result in differences in the specific EHI export data provided: 
			<ul>
                <li>Version of software in use.</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Intergy Minimum Supported Version: 21.24.00.00</li>
				<li>Prime Suite Minimum Supported Version: 21.23.00.00</li>
				</ul>
                <li>Software's system configuration and settings implemented by the health organization.</li>
                <li>Health organization's policies and practices related to workflow and documentation.</li>
                <li>Application integrations used.</li>
            </ul>
			</p>
			<p>For the following supporting products/modules, please select the EHI Export capability of the EHR you use.: 
			<ul>
                <li>Greenway Insights (GI)</li>
				<li>Greenway Patient Portal (GPP)</li>
