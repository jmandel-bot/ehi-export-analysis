    "description": "SCC Soft Computer is a laboratory information systems (LIS) vendor, not a full EHR. Founded in 1979, they are a leading provider of laboratory, genetics, blood services, and outreach information management systems. The certified module SoftLab is the core LIS, but the broader product family includes SoftMic (microbiology), SoftBank (blood bank), SoftPathDx (pathology), SoftGene/SoftGenomics (genetics), SoftMolecular (molecular diagnostics), SoftBill/SoftAR (lab billing/AR), and SoftMedia (document management). The EHI export covers all of these modules. Critically, this is NOT a full EHR — it does not have patient portals, clinical documentation (progress notes, assessments), medication management, appointment scheduling, or any of the typical ambulatory/inpatient EHR functions. Patient demographics and insurance data flow into the system from external HIS/EMR systems via ADT feeds. The product does store lab-specific billing data through SoftBill/SoftAR modules, and the SoftLab product page explicitly mentions 'complete audit trails and processing history' and 'real-time billing' as features.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "The EHI export uses two complementary formats: (1) HL7 v2.5.1 result messages for clinical laboratory data — one message per ordered test, covering all specialties (chemistry, microbiology, blood bank, pathology, genetics) — and (2) XML for billing history from SoftBill/SoftAR. Additionally, linked documents from SoftMedia (PDF reports, images of any common type) are included as raw files. The export is packaged as a ZIP file containing: HL7 result messages in a .txt file, billing XML files, linked SoftMedia documents, and a ReadMe with links to the specifications. This is a thoughtful approach for a LIS — they use HL7, which is the native interchange format for lab results, rather than trying to force lab data into FHIR or C-CDA. The HL7 messages carry detailed structured data including patient demographics, insurance, next of kin, diagnoses, specimen details, and observation results. Single-patient export is self-service via the EhiExportConsole application; bulk/population export requires SCC services involvement.",

  "documentation_quality": {
    "description": "Excellent documentation for a LIS vendor. The main HL7 specification (55 pages for v4.5) provides field-level detail for every HL7 segment used: MSH, PID, NK1, PV1, IN1, ORC, OBR, OBX, NTE, DG1, SPM, FHS, and FTS. Each field includes sequence number, element name, cardinality, data type (DT, ID, NM, ST, TS, TX), required/optional status, output value description, and detailed rules/notes. The document includes 23+ specific rules covering edge cases like MRN prefixes, escape sequences, microbiology organism-sensitivity cross-referencing, blood bank product formatting, and narrative vs. discrete result handling. The billing XML specification (14 pages) documents all XML elements with types, cardinality, and notes, plus provides a complete example XML message. Both documents use a convention system to indicate standard vs. optional vs. unavailable elements. The documentation was clearly authored in Excel (referenced as .xlsx files in footers) and exported to PDF. The Excel source files are not available for download, which is a minor gap.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "For a laboratory information system, this export is remarkably comprehensive. It covers all the data that a LIS would reasonably store: lab results across all specialties (chemistry, micro, blood bank, pathology, genetics), patient demographics (full — name, DOB, sex, race, ethnicity, addresses, phone numbers, employer info), insurance information, next of kin, diagnoses associated with orders, specimen details, linked documents/images, and billing history with charge-level detail including actual dollar amounts. The absence of secure messages, appointments, and audit trails from the export is notable but largely explained by the product's nature as a LIS — it simply doesn't store most of that data. The one genuine gap is audit trails: the SoftLab product page explicitly mentions 'complete audit trails and processing history' as a feature, yet no audit data appears in the EHI export. This is the most significant omission given that audit data is stored in the system.",

OBX segments carry observation values, units, normal ranges, abnormal flags, result status, timestamps. OBR segments carry order details, specimen info, ordering/performing provider details. DG1 segments carry diagnoses. SPM segments carry specimen details. NTE segments carry comments at patient, visit, order, and result levels."

This confirms audit data is stored in the system but not included in the EHI export — a genuine coverage gap."

  "summary": "SCC Soft Computer's EHI export is well-designed for a laboratory information system. It uses HL7 v2.5.1 for lab results (covering chemistry, microbiology, blood bank, pathology, and genetics), XML for billing history with real dollar amounts, and includes linked documents/images from SoftMedia — all packaged in a ZIP file. The documentation is excellent with field-level detail, data types, and example data. The main gap is that audit trail data, which the product explicitly stores ('complete audit trails and processing history'), is absent from the export. Several EHI categories (secure messages, appointments) are reasonably absent because this is a LIS, not a full EHR.",

  "notes": "SCC Soft Computer is a specialty LIS vendor, so evaluating their EHI export against the full 7-category framework requires context. Many categories (secure messages, appointments, clinical notes) simply don't exist in a laboratory information system. The relevant question is whether they export everything a LIS stores — and they come very close, with the notable exception of audit trails. The HL7 v2.5.1 format is a sensible choice for lab data, as it's the native interchange standard for lab results and carries more structured detail than either C-CDA or FHIR could for this domain. The billing XML includes genuine financial detail with charge amounts, payments, and balances — not just codes. The SoftMedia document inclusion is a nice touch that ensures reference lab PDF reports and linked images aren't lost."
