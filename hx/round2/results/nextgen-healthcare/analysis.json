  "product_context": {
    "description": "NextGen Healthcare (NASDAQ: NXGN) is a major ambulatory EHR and practice management vendor serving physician practices of all sizes across 40+ specialties. The certified module 'NextGen Enterprise EHR' is one component of a much broader product suite that includes Practice Management (billing, scheduling, registration, claims), Patient Experience (patient portal with secure text messaging, online scheduling, payments), Revenue Cycle Management (clearinghouse, claims processing, denial management), NextGen Office (cloud-based EHR/PM for smaller practices), Direct Messaging, and Mirth Connect (interoperability engine). The homepage describes the platform as 'Intelligent EHR, PM, Patient Experience, and RCMS.' The patient portal explicitly offers secure text messaging — a customer quote on the website states patients are 'sending us lots of messages, so that they don't have to call us on the phone.' The PM solution has been ranked #1 by Black Book Research for 9 consecutive years. The full product clearly stores billing/claims data, insurance/eligibility data, scheduling data, patient portal messages, and documents in addition to clinical data.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "The export approach varies by product. NextGen Enterprise EHR uses a native database export — the 10,875-page data dictionary documents the schema of internal database tables with SQL Server data types (char, varchar, uniqueidentifier, datetime, int, etc.). This is a direct dump of the EHR's clinical database tables, which is the gold standard approach. However, the export appears to be limited to the EHR database only and does not include Practice Management (PM) database tables for billing, claims, payments, A/R, or scheduling. NextGen Office exports as a ZIP archive containing CCDA XML, CSV, binary files (images/PDFs), and HTML files — a mixed approach. NextGen Direct Messaging exports as ZIP with CDA XML and binary files. Mirth Connect exports messages with attachments in XML format with base64-encoded attachments. Of the four products, only Enterprise EHR has detailed schema documentation; the other three have only brief format descriptions.",

Each table entry includes column names, data types, default values, and not-null constraints. However, the documentation is ONLY provided as a massive 29 MB PDF, which is very difficult to work with programmatically. There is no HTML viewer, no downloadable CSV/JSON schema, no search functionality. The documentation does NOT include: value set definitions (what codes mean), relationships between tables (no foreign key documentation), sample data, or narrative descriptions of what each table contains. The table names use internal naming conventions — many are specialty-specific prefixes (CARD_ for cardiology, AINF_ for ancillary/infusion, HPI_ for history of present illness, bh_ for behavioral health, etc.) that require domain knowledge to interpret. The other three products (Office, Direct Messaging, Mirth Connect) have almost no documentation — just a few sentences describing the file format of the export with no schema detail.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "The NextGen Enterprise EHR export is massively detailed on the clinical side — 5,077 tables spanning 40+ medical specialties with deep clinical template data. The strength is clearly clinical documentation: specialty-specific encounter templates for cardiology, behavioral health, OB/GYN, orthopedics, pediatrics, ophthalmology, ENT, GI, pulmonology, dermatology, rheumatology, and many more. However, there is a significant gap: the export appears to be limited to the EHR's clinical database and does not include the Practice Management (PM) database. No dedicated billing transaction tables, claims tables, payment ledger tables, accounts receivable tables, or insurance enrollment tables appear in the data dictionary. The billing-related content that IS present consists of clinical billing references (superbill templates, fee sheet CPT/DX associations, one NGWEB_STATEMENT_PAYMENT table for portal payments), not the full revenue cycle data. Given that NextGen's PM solution is a core component of the broader product — ranked #1 by Black Book Research — and stores extensive billing, claims, scheduling, and insurance data, this appears to be a substantial coverage gap. Similarly, patient portal secure messages appear absent, despite the product explicitly offering this functionality. The other three products (Office, Direct Messaging, Mirth Connect) have minimal documentation, making it impossible to fully assess their export coverage.",
    "clinical": {
      "present": true,
      "evidence": "Extremely strong clinical coverage across 5,077 tables. Includes: diagnoses/problems (Diagnostics_, OB_Diagnostics_, info_chronic_problems_), medications (MedicationChanges_, Associate_Medications_), allergies (AllergyMaster_, Allergy_Table_, CARD_Allergies_), vitals (vital_signs_ and 10+ specialty variants), labs/results (lab-related tables, CARD result wizards for various tests), immunizations (Immunization_Rec_, adult_immunizations_), procedures (CARD_Procedures_, proc_ tables), clinical notes (CARD_ProgressNote_, CARD_ChartNotes_, ChartNotesExtPop_), assessments (Assessment_, Assessment_Info_), care plans (FollowUp_Plans_, DCE_CCMPlanOfCare_), family history (Family_Hx_Dtl_, CARD_FamilyHistory_), social history (Social_Hx_, adult_social_history_), problem lists, advance directives (advance_directives_, bh_psych_adv_directives_), and extensive specialty-specific templates for 40+ specialties including cardiology (250 CARD_ tables), behavioral health (177 bh_ tables), OB/GYN, orthopedics, ophthalmology, ENT, GI, pulmonology, dermatology, and more. The depth of clinical specialty content is among the most comprehensive seen."

None of these appear to be patient portal secure messaging tables. The Prov_communication_ tables are provider-to-provider records, not patient-provider messages. The portal tables relate to document posting, not messaging. NextGen's product explicitly advertises 'Secure text messaging' in the patient portal and a customer quote describes patients 'sending us lots of messages.' The absence of patient-provider secure messaging tables from the export is a significant gap."

There are column-level references to copay (actFeeCoPay, encounter_copay_amt, copay_ind), deductible (deductible_amt), balance_due, txt_charge_amount, and a few price fields (Unit_Price, cash_price10, retail_price6). However, there are NO dedicated claims tables, payment ledger tables, accounts receivable tables, transaction history tables, adjustment tables, EOB tables, or billing statement tables that would be expected from a full Practice Management system. The PM product is a major component of NextGen Healthcare — ranked #1 by Black Book for billing — yet its transaction-level data appears absent from the EHI export."

Also found AINF_Payer_Override_Config_ and CMSICDCoverage_. However, there are no dedicated insurance enrollment tables, eligibility verification tables, authorization/pre-certification tracking tables (beyond clinical workflow ainf_pre_cert tables), payer master tables, or benefits detail tables. The insurance data present is embedded within clinical encounter contexts, not as standalone insurance/coverage entities. The bh_authorizations_ table exists for behavioral health but appears specialty-specific."

Also encounter-related visit tables across specialties (AINF_PT_single_visit_, CARD_DoctorVisits_, CARD_HospitalVisit_). While scheduling data is present, it appears to be clinical-side scheduling (encounter-linked) rather than the full PM scheduling module with time slots, resource calendars, and booking management."

    "documents_images": {
      "present": true,

The landing page explicitly states 'While certain EHI, such as images, documents, reports, and audio files are referenced in the tables, they are located in the corresponding file folders in the extract.' This confirms that binary files (images, documents, reports, audio) are exported as separate files alongside the database tables."

Most tables have created_by/modified_by integer fields (user IDs) and timestamps, providing some change tracking. However, there are no dedicated system access audit trail tables documenting who accessed which patient record, when, and what they viewed — the type of audit trail that would typically be maintained in a separate audit database for HIPAA compliance."

  "summary": "NextGen Healthcare provides a massive 10,875-page database dictionary for the Enterprise EHR covering ~5,077 tables with excellent clinical depth across 40+ medical specialties. However, the export appears to cover only the EHR clinical database, not the Practice Management database that stores billing transactions, claims, payments, and full scheduling data — a significant gap given that PM is a core product component. Patient portal secure messaging, full insurance enrollment data, and system access audit trails also appear absent. The documentation is only available as a 29 MB PDF with no machine-readable alternative, and the URL is obfuscated with noindex tags to prevent discovery.",

  "notes": "The table naming conventions reveal the specialty-template architecture: CARD_ (250 tables, cardiology), AINF_ (204 tables, ancillary/infusion/PT), HPI_ (131+ tables, history of present illness), bh_ (177 tables, behavioral health), PEDS_ (51 tables, pediatrics), OB_ (46 tables, obstetrics), ENT_ (28 tables, ear/nose/throat), IORTS_ (65+ tables, orthopedics/surgical), pe_ (185 tables, physical exam), info_ (251 tables, information/utility), tis_ (184 tables), and many more. This specialty-template architecture means the clinical data is extremely rich but also very wide — many tables contain overlapping data for different specialty workflows. The 'created_by' and 'modified_by' integer fields appear on virtually every table, providing basic change attribution but not a comprehensive access audit trail. The page also serves as the documentation hub for NextGen Office, Direct Messaging, and Mirth Connect, but those products have only brief format descriptions (CCDA/CSV for Office, CDA for Direct Messaging, XML for Mirth Connect) with no detailed schema documentation."
