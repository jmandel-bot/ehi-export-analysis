The other two products (ConnectEHR/CQMSolution, Patient Portal) link to HubSpot pages with procedural export instructions.

    "description": "Juno Health (formerly DSS Inc.) develops healthcare software primarily for critical access and rural hospitals, behavioral health facilities, public health organizations, and state mental health agencies. Ranked #1 EHR for rural hospitals by Black Book Research in 2025. The product suite spans a full acute care EHR (Juno EHR) with clinical documentation, pharmacy, lab, imaging, scheduling, billing/RCM, surgery, nutrition, and care planning; a standalone pharmacy/medication tracking system (RxTracker); an interoperability/HIE module (ConnectEHR); a clinical quality measures tool (CQMSolution); and a patient portal. The table naming conventions (AU_PRESCRIPTION, AU_PHARMACY_PATIENT) strongly suggest VistA/CPRS heritage — 'AU' refers to automated pharmacy utilities from the VA's VistA system, consistent with DSS Inc.'s history of building commercial products on top of the VA's open-source EHR. Five separate products are certified, each with its own CHPL listing and export approach. Juno EHR is the core product storing the vast majority of patient data; the others are more specialized modules.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Juno Health takes a multi-product, mixed-format approach to EHI export. The core product (Juno EHR) exports native database tables as CSV files — 1,256 documented tables reflecting the actual SQL Server schema. This is a gold-standard database-native export. RxTracker similarly exports 66 native database CSV tables. ConnectEHR exports C-CDA 2.1 XML documents (limited to USCDIv1 scope). CQMSolution exports QRDA I XML files (clinical quality data only). Patient Portal exports C-CDA formatted documents. The Juno EHR native export is the workhorse — it covers billing (RCM1500CLAIM, RCMUB04CLAIM), scheduling (SCHEDULE, SCHEDULESESSION), insurance (COVERAGE, ENCOUNTERINSURANCE), documents (DOCUMENTREFERENCE, FILESTORAGE, MEDIA), medications, labs, notes, care plans, and extensive lookup tables. The C-CDA exports from ConnectEHR and Patient Portal would only add clinical summary data already present in the Juno EHR native export. Non-tabular data (images, PDFs, XML, text documents) are exported alongside the CSVs to the host directory. The export is described as a 'manual one-time export' triggered per-patient or per-population.",

    "description": "The Juno EHR documentation is excellent for the native database export: 1,256 individually documented tables, each with column names, SQL Server data types (INT, NVARCHAR, BIT, DATE, DATETIMEOFFSET, UNIQUEIDENTIFIER, etc.), ordinal positions, primary keys, and foreign key relationships to other tables. Table descriptions are provided but are often minimal (e.g., 'The primary key of the X table'). The foreign key documentation is particularly valuable — it shows how tables relate to each other (e.g., PATIENT references PATIENTDECEASED, LKMARITALSTATUS, LKRELIGION). The extensive LK* (lookup) tables document code sets and value domains. RxTracker has similar per-table documentation for its 66 tables. The ConnectEHR and Patient Portal pages provide only procedural instructions (how to run the export) with no schema detail — understandable since their exports are C-CDA/QRDA standards. No sample data is provided. No version numbers or last-updated dates are visible on the documentation itself.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "Juno EHR's native database export of 1,256 tables provides exceptionally comprehensive EHI coverage. This is one of the more thorough export schemas encountered — it covers clinical data, billing/RCM (including CMS-1500 and UB-04 claim forms with dollar amounts and line-item detail), insurance coverage, scheduling/appointments, documents/images, care plans, surgery records, nutrition requests, pharmacy (with VA-heritage AU_PRESCRIPTION tables), and imaging studies. The main gap is in secure messaging: while lookup tables for message categories, types, folders, and statuses exist (LKMESSAGECATEGORY, LKMESSAGEFOLDER, LKACTIVEMESSAGECONVERSATION, etc.), no actual message content tables appear in the export. This suggests the system has a messaging infrastructure whose content tables are not included. Audit trails are partially covered through ViewedBy tables (SENSITIVEPATIENTVIEWEDBY, DIAGNOSTICREPORTVIEWEDBY) and history tables (ENCOUNTERSTATUSHISTORY, PATIENTDEMOGRAPHICSHISTORY, SCHEDULEHISTORY), plus TRACE_XE_ACTION_MAP and TRACE_XE_EVENT_MAP (SQL Server Extended Events traces), though these appear to be more clinical workflow tracking than comprehensive access audit logs. The RxTracker export adds 66 pharmacy-specific tables. ConnectEHR (C-CDA) and Patient Portal (C-CDA) exports are limited to clinical summary data and add no data beyond what's already in the Juno EHR native export.",

TRACE_XE_ACTION_MAP and TRACE_XE_EVENT_MAP suggest SQL Server Extended Events trace data is included. PROVENANCE and PROVENANCEAGENT tables track data provenance.

    "ConnectEHR documentation explicitly states certification under 'limited ePHI USCDIv1 definition' — this suggests a narrower scope than full EHI for that particular product.",
    "No downloadable archive (ZIP/PDF) of the complete documentation — the 1,256 individual table HTML pages would require scraping to capture fully, though the index page lists all tables.",
    "Table descriptions are often minimal or circular (e.g., 'The primary key of the X table') rather than providing meaningful context about what the table stores.",
    "No documentation version or last-updated date visible on any of the schema pages, making it difficult to assess currency."

  "summary": "Juno Health provides one of the more comprehensive EHI export implementations among mid-size EHR vendors. The core Juno EHR product exports 1,256 native database tables as CSV files with field-level SQL Server schema documentation, covering clinical data, billing/RCM (including complete CMS-1500 and UB-04 claims with dollar amounts), insurance coverage, appointments/scheduling, documents/images, and partial audit trails. The main gap is secure messaging — lookup tables for message types and folders exist but actual message content tables are absent from the export. Four additional products (RxTracker, ConnectEHR, CQMSolution, Patient Portal) have separate exports, with the latter three using limited C-CDA/QRDA formats that add little beyond the Juno EHR native export.",

  "notes": "The AU_* table prefix in Juno EHR tables (AU_PRESCRIPTION, AU_PHARMACY_PATIENT, etc.) strongly indicates VistA/CPRS heritage from the VA's open-source EHR system. This is consistent with Juno Health's origins as DSS Inc., a company that commercialized VistA for non-VA healthcare facilities. The table naming throughout the schema also shows FHIR-influenced naming conventions (OBSERVATION, CONDITION, MEDICATIONREQUEST, CAREPLAN) suggesting a modernized data model that maps to FHIR concepts while retaining the legacy pharmacy subsystem. The 1,322 combined table count (1,256 Juno EHR + 66 RxTracker) places this among the more detailed EHI export documentation sets encountered, comparable to large-scale vendors like Epic in terms of native database transparency."
