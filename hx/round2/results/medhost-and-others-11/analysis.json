    "description": "MEDHOST is a healthcare IT company serving hospitals and healthcare facilities, with particular strength in the emergency department and community/rural hospital market. The product suite is a full hospital EHR platform with multiple certified modules: MEDHOST EDIS (Emergency Department Information System), MEDHOST Enterprise Clinicals (hospital EHR clinical documentation), MEDHOST Enterprise Financials (revenue cycle, accounts payable, general ledger, materials management), YourCareCommunity Patient Portal (patient-facing portal with health record access and fitness data integration), and YourCareCommunity Provider Portal. The Enterprise EHR includes clinical suites (clinician, physician, perioperative, anesthesia, pharmacy), scheduling, document management (DMS), and public health reporting. The EDIS product is a specialized ED system with touch-screen charting, order entry, charge capture, triage, and barcode medication scanning. The financial suite includes accounts payable, general ledger, materials management, credit card processing, and corporate reporting. The patient portal supports health info exchange and integration with wearable devices (Fitbit, Garmin). This is a comprehensive hospital IT platform — the EHI export should cover data from all these modules.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "MEDHOST uses FHIR R4 v4.0.1 as the structure for EHI export. The export generates multiple NDJSON files per patient, packaged as a compressed ZIP file. Two export types are supported: single-patient (initiated by patient via YourCare portal or by facility administrator) and system-wide (administrator-only). MEDHOST extends standard FHIR R4 resources with additional fields to accommodate data captured in MEDHOST that is not defined in FHIR R4 — these extensions are documented in an XLSX file. The export is FHIR-based but goes beyond standard FHIR by adding 713 extension fields across 41 resource types. This hybrid approach means the export benefits from FHIR's structure while carrying additional vendor-specific data. However, it still inherits FHIR R4's structural limitations — FHIR R4 does not have well-defined resources for billing line items with dollar amounts, insurance claim adjudication details, portal messages, or audit trails.",

The XLSX file (last modified December 2022) documents only MEDHOST's FHIR extension fields — the fields that go beyond standard FHIR R4. It does NOT document the standard FHIR R4 fields included in each resource; a reader must cross-reference the HL7 FHIR R4 specification for those. Each extension field has a name, version, FHIR type, max length, description, and internal database table/column references (labeled 'internal use only') for both Enterprise and EDIS systems. The internal DB column references are extremely valuable — they show exactly which database tables the data comes from (e.g., 'BILMST50.SUM(CGDAMT)' for appointment charges). There are no sample NDJSON files, no enumerated list of which FHIR resource types are included in the export, and no documentation of the ZIP file structure. The Directions sheet shows how extension URLs are formatted. The documentation version appears to be '2022r1'.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "MEDHOST's FHIR-based export with extensions covers clinical data comprehensively and includes notable non-clinical categories that many FHIR-based exports miss — particularly insurance/coverage with authorization details and dollar amounts, appointment scheduling with charges, and charge items with CPT codes. The 713 extension fields show genuine effort to go beyond standard FHIR R4. However, there are significant gaps. The product includes a patient portal (YourCareCommunity) and a full financial suite (Enterprise - Financials with AP, GL, materials management), but the export documentation shows no evidence of portal messaging, no claims/payments data (only charge items), and no audit trails. The Encounter resource has 102 extension fields including financial class, deposit amounts, and charge amounts — suggesting deep encounter-level data. The Coverage resource has 30 extension fields including authorization details (numbers, periods, approved/denied days, reasons). This is a better-than-average FHIR-based export, but the absence of messaging, claims adjudication, and audit data is notable for a platform with five certified products.",

No Communication, MessageHeader, or similar messaging resource is included. The product includes YourCareCommunity Patient Portal (a separately certified product) which would store patient-provider communications, but this data appears absent from the export."

Ancillary Order includes billing G-codes, billing modifiers, billing system name, billing result text, and charge type. Procedure includes billing-sequence-number.

  "summary": "MEDHOST exports EHI as FHIR R4 NDJSON files in a ZIP archive, with 713 vendor-specific extension fields across 41 resource types that go meaningfully beyond standard FHIR R4 — particularly for insurance coverage (30 extension fields with authorization details and dollar amounts), encounters (102 extensions with financial and administrative data), and charge items. However, the export has significant gaps given that MEDHOST has five separately certified products: secure messaging from the patient portal is absent, document/image data from the DMS is absent, comprehensive financial data (claims, payments, AR, AP, GL) from Enterprise Financials is missing despite charge capture being present, and there is no dedicated audit trail export. The documentation itself is minimal — a single 2022-vintage XLSX file documenting only FHIR extensions, with no sample files, no export structure docs, and no list of included resource types.",

  "notes": "The internal database column references in the XLSX file (labeled 'internal use only') are revealing: they show tables like BILMST50, PATHIST, RXPROFPP, OEORDER, MREROIR, CHPPROBP, etc. — indicating a substantial underlying database with far more data than what surfaces through the FHIR resource model. The 'Y database table/col' column in some sheets (Allergy, FamilyMemberHistory, Immunization, MedicationStatement-HomeMed) likely refers to the YourCareCommunity portal database, suggesting some portal data is mapped but limited to clinical records rather than messaging. The EDIS column is frequently 'N/A' for many fields, suggesting the EDIS emergency department system may have a more limited export compared to Enterprise Clinicals."
