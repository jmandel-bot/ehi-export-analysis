## Navigation Journal

### Step 1: Initial probe

```bash
curl -sI -L "https://www.medhost.com/ehr/interoperability/" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
```

**Result**: HTTP/2 200 directly (no redirects). Content-Type: `text/html; charset=UTF-8`. WordPress site hosted on WP Engine behind Cloudflare. Page ID 2282. No content-disposition headers — this is an HTML page, not a direct file download.

### Step 2: Page examination

```bash
curl -sL "https://www.medhost.com/ehr/interoperability/" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o /tmp/page.html
wc -c /tmp/page.html
```

**Result**: 198,235 bytes of HTML. WordPress site with WP Rocket lazy-loading JavaScript (RocketLazyLoadScripts). The initial HTML source is large and contains mostly deferred JavaScript wrappers, CSS, and RocketLoader boilerplate. However, the actual page content IS present in the HTML — it's not a pure SPA. Content is readable via `grep` even without JavaScript execution.

### Step 3: Finding the EHI section

Searched the HTML source for EHI-related content:

```bash
grep -oiE 'href="[^"]*\.(pdf|zip|xlsx|xls|csv|json|doc|docx)[^"]*"' /tmp/page.html
```

**Result**: Found one downloadable file link:
- `href="https://www.medhost.com/fhir/extensions/MEDHOST-FHIR-Extension-Fields.xlsx"`

Searched for EHI section by ID:
```bash
grep -i 'EHIExport' /tmp/page.html
```

**Result**: Found `<section id="EHIExport">` — a dedicated section on the page with anchor ID "EHIExport".

The page structure (from `<section>` elements):
1. Hero: "MEDHOST and Interoperability"
2. "Enhancing care coordination with solutions that drive interoperability"
3. MEDHOST Cures 2023 Interoperability Solution / Electronic Case Reporting links
4. Feature sections: Patient Health Record Exchange, Connecting the Community, Patient Access and Engagement, Public Health Reporting, Managed Integration Services, Memberships and Partnerships
5. **"EHI Export"** ← section id="EHIExport"
6. Interoperability Resource Center (marketing content)
7. CTA / Footer

The EHI Export section is near the bottom of the page. No accordion or click-to-expand needed — it's directly visible upon scrolling down.

### Step 4: EHI Export section content

The EHI Export section contains the following text (confirmed both via HTML source and browser):

> **EHI Export**
>
> MEDHOST supports two types of electronic health information export:
> - Single patient
> - System
>
> A patient can initiate single-patient exports if the facility utilizes the MEDHOST YourCare® Universe patient portal product. It can be generated by an administrator at the facility on behalf of the patient. The extract is then available to the patient via a secure link that is sent to the patient's email address upon completion of the export.
>
> System exports can only be initiated by an administrator (MEDHOST/facility).
>
> MEDHOST utilizes the [FHIR R4 v 4.0.1](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/) as a guideline for the structure of electronic health information (EHI). In some cases, MEDHOST adds additional fields to some of these resources to accommodate data fields that are captured in MEDHOST but are not defined in the FHIR R4 standard. Documentation for these "extensions" are available [here](https://www.medhost.com/fhir/extensions/MEDHOST-FHIR-Extension-Fields.xlsx).
>
> The EHI Export process generates multiple NDJSON files per patient that are presented to the user as a compressed (zip) file.

The "here" link points to the XLSX file: `https://www.medhost.com/fhir/extensions/MEDHOST-FHIR-Extension-Fields.xlsx`

### Step 5: Additional subpages checked

Checked the "MEDHOST Cures 2023 Interoperability Solution" subpage:
```bash
curl -sL "https://www.medhost.com/ehr/interoperability/medhost-cures-2023-interoperability-solution/" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o /tmp/cures2023.html
```

**Result**: Marketing page. Key statement: "Enables export of EHI (single patient and system) in machine computable format. Single patient export from the patient portal." No additional documentation files.

Checked the HTI program page:
```bash
curl -sL "https://www.medhost.com/ehr/interoperability/medhost-hti-program/" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0'
```

**Result**: Marketing page about HTI-1 compliance. No additional EHI export documentation.

Checked the FHIR directory for additional files:
```bash
curl -sI "https://www.medhost.com/fhir/" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0'
curl -sI "https://www.medhost.com/fhir/extensions/" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0'
```

**Result**: Both return 403 Forbidden. No directory listing. Only the direct XLSX file URL works.

### Step 6: Identified downloadable assets

| # | File | URL | Type |
|---|------|-----|------|
| 1 | MEDHOST-FHIR-Extension-Fields.xlsx | https://www.medhost.com/fhir/extensions/MEDHOST-FHIR-Extension-Fields.xlsx | Excel 2007+ (FHIR extension field documentation) |

The only EHI export documentation artifact is a single XLSX file documenting the FHIR extension fields that MEDHOST adds beyond standard FHIR R4. The standard FHIR R4 resource fields are not separately documented — MEDHOST references the HL7 FHIR R4 specification directly.

## Obstacles & Notes

1. **WordPress with RocketLoader**: The site uses WP Rocket for JavaScript lazy loading, but the actual HTML content is present in the source. No browser execution was required to find the EHI section or download link, though the browser confirmed the visual layout.

2. **Documentation is minimal**: The entire EHI export documentation consists of a brief paragraph on the interoperability page plus a single XLSX file. The XLSX only documents MEDHOST's *extensions* to standard FHIR R4 resources — it does not list the complete set of FHIR R4 fields that are included. A reader is expected to cross-reference the HL7 FHIR R4 specification for the base fields.

3. **No list of exported FHIR resources**: The interoperability page does not enumerate which FHIR resources are included in the EHI export. The only way to determine this is by looking at the sheet names in the XLSX file, which implicitly indicate 41 resource types.

4. **XLSX file is from 2022**: The file metadata shows it was last modified on 2022-12-05. It's unclear whether it has been updated to reflect any changes since then.

5. **Cloudflare protection**: The site is behind Cloudflare but did not block curl requests with a standard User-Agent header. No CAPTCHA or challenge pages were encountered.
