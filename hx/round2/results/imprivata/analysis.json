  "product_context": {
    "description": "Imprivata is NOT an EHR vendor. These certified products are audit, surveillance, and compliance tools that monitor access to healthcare IT systems. FairWarning (acquired by Imprivata) was originally a standalone patient privacy monitoring product that detects inappropriate access to medical records ('snooping'), HIPAA violations, and insider threats. It evolved into Digital Identity Intelligence and then Access Intelligence, which is the current umbrella product containing Patient Privacy Intelligence (PPI), Drug Diversion Intelligence (DDI), and User/Entity Behavior Analytics. These products ingest access audit logs from 500+ healthcare applications (Epic, Cerner, Meditech, Allscripts, etc.) and store metadata about who accessed patient records, when, from what system, and what type of access. The products do NOT store clinical data, billing data, insurance data, appointments, messages, or documents — only metadata about access to those things in other systems. The EHI they export is audit trail data: records of access events tied to patients. This is a legitimate, if narrow, form of EHI under the Designated Record Set. The certified module IS the entire product — there is no broader product with clinical capabilities.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "The export is a CSV file generated from the 'Report Results' page within the application. Data fields included in the export are configurable by end users. Permissions for export are governed by User Role and can be limited to specific EHI data sources. The RWTP confirms that export testing involves exporting EHI for a single patient and comparing record counts against a database report for accuracy validation. This is essentially a report-based export — users run a report (presumably filtering by patient or other criteria) and export the results as CSV. The exported data is audit trail records: who accessed a patient's records, when, in what system, and what they did. This is a simple, appropriate approach for a product that stores structured tabular data (access logs) rather than complex clinical documents.",

  "documentation_quality": {
    "description": "The documentation is extremely minimal — a single paragraph on the ONC disclosure page describing that CSV export exists from the Report Results page with user-configurable fields. There is no data dictionary, no schema documentation, no field-level detail, no enumeration of available data elements, no sample data, no technical specification. The Real World Testing Plan PDF adds slight context (confirms CSV format, mentions database record count comparison) but provides no additional schema detail. A developer receiving an export would get a CSV file with column headers but would have no external reference documentation to understand the field semantics, data types, or relationships. For a product that stores relatively simple tabular data (access logs), this minimal documentation may be less problematic than it would be for a complex EHR, but it still fails to meet the spirit of the b(10) documentation requirement.",

    "overall_assessment": "This is a fundamentally different type of health IT product than a traditional EHR. Imprivata's certified products store audit trail data — records of who accessed patient information in other systems (Epic, Cerner, etc.). The EHI they export is access log data, which is a legitimate but narrow category of EHI. The export appears to cover the product's primary data store (access audit events) via configurable CSV export. However, because this is an audit/surveillance tool and not an EHR, the standard seven EHI categories (clinical, billing, insurance, etc.) are largely inapplicable. The only relevant category is audit trails, which is the product's core function. The documentation is too vague to confirm whether ALL stored data is exportable — the 'configurable by end users' language could mean users can select which fields to include, but it's unclear whether all fields are available for selection or whether some data (e.g., investigation workflow data, case management data, risk scores) is excluded.",

      "evidence": "This IS the product's core function. Imprivata stores access audit trail data from 500+ healthcare applications — who accessed which patient's records, when, from what system, and what type of access occurred. The CSV export from the Report Results page exports this audit data. The RWTP confirms 'export of all patient's EHI' which in this context means all audit records associated with a patient. However, the documentation does not enumerate the specific fields available in the export, so we cannot confirm completeness of audit data coverage (e.g., whether investigation workflow data, risk scores, and case management data from the compliance module are also included)."
    }
  },

  "issues": [
    "Documentation is a single paragraph with no data dictionary, schema, field definitions, or technical specification — arguably fails the b(10)(iii) documentation requirement.",
    "No enumeration of what data fields are available for export, making it impossible to independently assess completeness.",
    "The phrase 'Data fields included in the export capabilities are configurable by end users' is ambiguous — it could mean users select from all available fields, or it could mean the administrator has pre-configured which fields are available.",
    "The phrase 'can also be limited to specific EHI data sources' suggests export may not include all data sources by default, potentially allowing organizations to restrict export scope.",
    "No information about whether investigation/case management data, behavioral analytics results, risk scores, or drug diversion monitoring data are included in the export alongside raw access logs.",
    "Product stores data from 500+ integrated applications but documentation does not clarify whether audit data from all integrated sources is exportable or only from specific ones."

  "summary": "Imprivata's certified products (Access Intelligence, Digital Identity Intelligence, FairWarning) are audit/surveillance tools that monitor access to EHR and other healthcare IT systems — not EHRs themselves. Their EHI export is a CSV export of access audit trail data from a Report Results page. The documentation is extremely minimal: a single paragraph with no data dictionary, no field definitions, and no schema. While the narrow scope of the export (audit logs) is appropriate for what the product stores, the lack of any technical documentation makes it impossible to assess completeness or help a recipient understand the exported data.",

  "notes": "This is an interesting edge case in ONC certification: a non-EHR health IT module certified for b(10) EHI export. The product's 'EHI' is entirely audit trail data, which is a legitimate component of the Designated Record Set. The four CHPL IDs represent three product names that are really an evolution of the same core product (FairWarning → Digital Identity Intelligence → Access Intelligence). The supported applications page (https://www.imprivata.com/analytics-intelligence-platform-supported-applications) lists 500+ integrated applications organized by category (EHR/EMR, Billing/Finance, Human Resources, Lab, Imaging, etc.), providing context for the breadth of access data the product monitors."
