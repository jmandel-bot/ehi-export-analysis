    "description": "Altera Digital Health (formerly Allscripts, spun off in 2022 and acquired by N. Harris Computer Corporation) is a major EHR vendor serving both inpatient and ambulatory settings. The certified products span a diverse portfolio: Sunrise is a full-featured acute care and ambulatory EHR for large hospital systems with integrated financials/revenue cycle management; TouchWorks EHR is an ambulatory EHR for physician practices with billing, scheduling, patient portal, and document management; Paragon EHR/Denali is designed for rural, critical access, and community hospitals, now cloud-deployed on Azure; Altera Lab is a laboratory information system; dbMotion is a health information exchange/aggregation platform that unifies data from multiple source systems; and Integrated Providers Patient Portal is a patient-facing portal product. The broader product ecosystem includes scheduling, billing/revenue cycle, patient portal messaging, document management, and clinical decision support across all major products. Each product has a separate EHI export mechanism and documentation — unusual compared to vendors with a single unified export.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Altera takes a product-specific approach to EHI export — each certified product has its own export format and documentation, reflecting the fact that these are distinct products with separate databases rather than modules of a single system.\n\n**Sunrise Acute Care / Ambulatory Care**: Native database export. The documentation is an ER Studio WebERDiagram covering 2,747 database tables across 4 submodels (SCM with 2,728 tables including 918 RCM/revenue cycle tables; IMG with 7 imaging tables; MNC with 11 tables; FS with 1 table). This is the gold standard approach — it documents the actual SQL Server database schema with full column definitions, data types, relationships, and descriptions. The export format appears to be direct database table extraction.\n\n**TouchWorks EHR**: Native database export. Documentation covers 551 tables across 8 SQL Server databases (Works with 516 tables, Impact with 22 document management tables, IntegratedScan with 6 tables including audit, AHSCharge with 2 billing reference tables, etc.). HTML-based interactive schema documentation with complete column-level detail including data types, lengths, nullability, and descriptions.\n\n**Paragon EHR / Denali**: FHIR R4 resource export. The documentation is a FHIR CapabilityStatement listing 48 FHIR resource types plus an Extension-Details spreadsheet with 827 custom extension definitions. This is a fundamentally different approach from Sunrise/TouchWorks — it maps internal data to standard FHIR resources rather than exporting raw database tables.\n\n**Altera Lab**: Custom JSON export. A 4-page PDF documents the JSON field labels and descriptions for lab-specific data (Patient, Encounters, Test Orders, Results, Observations).\n\n**dbMotion**: CSV file export. 19 CSV data files covering clinical domains (Encounters, Conditions, Medications, Immunizations, Labs/Pathology, Documents, Allergies, Imaging, Procedures) plus master/reference data. The reference guide explains the export process and permissions model.",

  "documentation_quality": {
    "description": "Documentation quality varies significantly by product but is generally strong for the database-native products.\n\n**Sunrise** has the most comprehensive documentation — 2,747 tables documented in an interactive ER diagram with full column-level detail including data types, descriptions, build version tracking, and relationship links. The WebERDiagram format is navigable via tree structure. At 81MB extracted, this is extremely thorough.\n\n**TouchWorks** is also well-documented with 551 tables across 8 databases. Each table page shows column names, data types, max lengths, nullability, identity fields, defaults, and descriptions. The Charge table, for example, has 31 columns with descriptions like 'Current billing status of the charge B - Submitted C - Cancel R - Removed...' — this is value-level documentation.\n\n**Paragon** documentation is adequate for a FHIR-based approach. The CapabilityStatement lists 48 resources with their supported interactions, and the Extension-Details spreadsheet documents 827 custom extensions with definitions. However, FHIR CapabilityStatements don't convey the same depth as database schemas.\n\n**Altera Lab** is minimal — a 4-page PDF covering basic JSON field labels for lab data. Adequate for a laboratory information system's limited scope.\n\n**dbMotion** provides a 17-page reference guide plus an Excel data dictionary with 19 sheets covering ~1,000+ field definitions. Well-structured but limited to clinical aggregation data.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "Altera's EHI export coverage is impressively comprehensive for the database-native products (Sunrise and TouchWorks) and adequate-to-limited for the FHIR and custom-format products (Paragon, Altera Lab, dbMotion).\n\n**Sunrise** (2,747 tables) is exceptionally thorough. The 918 RCM-prefixed tables alone demonstrate deep revenue cycle coverage. Tables covering scheduling (SXAAMBSVAppointment), messaging (SXAAMBSendMessageInstance, SXAGNMessage), insurance (SXAAMInsuranceCarrier, SXARCMAuthorizationStatusDictionary), documents (CV3ClientDocumentCUR, CV3PatientCareDocument), and audit (SXAEISAuditLogRecord, SXAGNAuditableEvent) show near-complete EHI coverage. The FS/IMG submodels add document binary storage.\n\n**TouchWorks** (551 tables) covers all major categories well: Charge/billing tables with dollar amounts (Charge.OverrideChargeAmount), insurance (Encounter_Insurance, Primary_Insurance, Visit_Insurance), appointments (Appointment, Schedule tables), documents (Impact database with DOC_HEADER, DOC_DETAIL, PATIENT_NOTES), patient portal activity (PatientPortalUserActivity, PatientPortalUserActivityDetail), patient communications (PatientCommunication), and audit (AUDIT_LOG, Audit_ChartView_DiscInfo, PatientAccessLog).\n\n**Paragon** (48 FHIR resources) includes Account, Claim, ChargeItem, Coverage, CoverageEligibilityRequest/Response, PaymentNotice, PaymentReconciliation, Communication, Appointment, DocumentReference — this is an unusually complete FHIR resource set that covers billing and administrative data better than most FHIR-based exports. However, FHIR inherently loses some granularity compared to native database exports.\n\n**Altera Lab** covers only lab-specific data (patient, encounters, orders, results, observations) — appropriate for a LIS.\n\n**dbMotion** covers clinical aggregation data only (no billing, scheduling, messaging, or audit) — appropriate for an HIE platform that aggregates clinical data from source systems.\n\nThe main gap is the **Integrated Providers Patient Portal** which has no EHI export documentation at all. If this portal stores messages, appointment requests, or other patient-generated data not captured by the underlying EHR's export, that data may be missing.",

    "dbMotion's export covers only clinical data categories (no billing, scheduling, messaging, or audit) — appropriate for an HIE platform but means data aggregated from non-clinical domains in source systems is not exported.",
    "Altera Lab's export documentation is minimal at 4 pages, though this is proportionate to a laboratory information system's scope.",
    "The five different export formats across products (database tables, FHIR R4, JSON, CSV) mean there is no unified export mechanism — organizations using multiple Altera products would need to perform separate exports from each system.",
    "Some product pages on the Altera website return 404 (e.g., TouchWorks EHR page), suggesting ongoing website restructuring that could affect documentation accessibility."

  "summary": "Altera Digital Health provides EHI export documentation for five distinct products using four different export approaches. The database-native exports for Sunrise (2,747 tables) and TouchWorks (551 tables) are among the most comprehensive EHI export documentation available from any vendor — they cover clinical, billing/revenue cycle, insurance, scheduling, messaging, documents, and audit data with full field-level schema detail. Paragon's FHIR R4 export with 48 resources is unusually complete for a FHIR-based approach, including billing and administrative resources. The main gaps are the absent documentation for the Integrated Providers Patient Portal and the inherent limitations of FHIR/CSV formats for the Paragon and dbMotion exports respectively.",

  "notes": "Altera Digital Health is notable for the diversity of its product portfolio and the corresponding diversity of export approaches. The Sunrise and TouchWorks products represent best-in-class EHI export documentation — native database schemas with thousands of tables covering the full breadth of EHI categories. The 918 RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) tables in Sunrise alone exceed the total table count of many other vendors' entire exports. The fact that each product has its own export mechanism reflects the reality that these are historically separate products (Sunrise from Eclipsys, TouchWorks/Paragon from legacy Allscripts/Misys) that were brought together through acquisitions. Organizations using multiple Altera products would need to coordinate exports from each system to capture all patient data."
