The product is a comprehensive Healthcare Information System (HCIS) spanning clinical, financial, and administrative domains. MEDITECH Expanse (current flagship) includes full EHR, Revenue Cycle/billing, Patient Connect portal with messaging, ambulatory/practice management with scheduling, pharmacy, ED, oncology, pathology, radiology, population health, surgical services, home care, mental health, and post-acute care. The certified modules collectively represent the entire HCIS — Core HCIS, ED Management, Ambulatory, Oncology, MyHealth Portal, and public health interfaces. The product spans multiple platform generations: Expanse 2.2/2.1 (current), 6.15/6.08 (prior), Client/Server 5.67, and MAGIC 5.67 (legacy).

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "MEDITECH uses a hybrid/mixed export approach that combines multiple formats within a single ZIP file. The export contains: (1) Electronic Chart documents — scanned/archived clinical documents as PDF/image files organized in category/subcategory folders; (2) US Core FHIR R4 resources — a JSON bundle via Patient $everything conforming to US Core STU 3.1.1; (3) C-CDA documents — structured clinical summaries; (4) Supplemental reports — financial, authorization, immunization, population health, utilization review data as text/PDF files; (5) For older platforms (Config 2: C/S, MAGIC, MPM 6.08), CSV files extracted from the Data Repository with structured table/column data. The approach varies significantly by platform generation. Notably, the newer Expanse platforms rely more heavily on the Electronic Chart (scanned documents) + FHIR + reports model, while older platforms additionally provide CSV data extracts from the Data Repository. The FHIR component covers standard US Core resources but would not include billing detail, messages (beyond clinical notes), or audit data. Financial data is exported as a text report (FinancialEHI.txt) rather than structured tabular data. Authorization data is exported as PDF. A Table of Contents in NDJSON (FHIR DocumentReference resources) provides machine-readable metadata for all files in the ZIP.",

However, the depth of documentation varies dramatically by platform. For older platforms (C/S, MAGIC, MPM 6.08), three PDF data dictionaries provide field-level detail mapping ~94-318 database tables with ~466-1,211 columns each, showing Field name, Table name, and Column name. These are genuine data repository schema documentation. For the newer Expanse platform (the most widely deployed), no equivalent field-level documentation exists — the documentation only describes sections at the folder/file level (e.g., 'FinancialEHI.txt — Contains a Patient Accounting report that includes financial transactions'). The FHIR component references US Core STU 3.1.1 at fhir.meditech.com but does not document MEDITECH-specific extensions or resource coverage. The PDFs are dated October 2023. No sample data, no value sets, no relationship documentation. The structural documentation is clear enough to understand what you'll get, but for Expanse users, you won't know the specific fields until you receive the actual export.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "MEDITECH's EHI export is a genuinely comprehensive attempt to cover all EHI categories, particularly impressive for the older platforms (C/S, MAGIC) where the CSV data extract from the Data Repository includes hundreds of tables spanning clinical, administrative, financial, and scheduling data at the field level. The export clearly includes financial transactions (PbrAccountTransactions, PbrAccountClaims), insurance data (AdmInsurances, AdmInsuredInfo with copay/deductible/policy/group), scheduling (SchAppointments plus extensive surgical case management), provider-patient messages, clinical documentation, and some audit trails. For the newer Expanse platform, the export takes a more document-centric approach — Electronic Chart files + FHIR + C-CDA + supplemental reports — which likely covers the same data categories but through rendered reports rather than structured database extracts. The financial data being exported as a text report (FinancialEHI.txt) rather than structured CSV on newer platforms is a step backward in machine-readability. The Authorization & Referral Management data is exported as PDF, which is also less machine-readable than structured data. Portal messages appear covered via 'Patient Notices' (6.08) and 'Provider Messages' (C/S, MAGIC) sections, and the CSV tables include AprEncMessages/AprEncMessagesLines. Audit data is limited — there's a PhaRxAuditDetailText table for medication audit trails in C/S, but no comprehensive access audit log. Overall, this is one of the more thorough EHI exports among major vendors, but the quality and machine-readability varies significantly by platform generation.",

  "summary": "MEDITECH provides a well-documented hybrid EHI export that combines Electronic Chart documents, FHIR US Core resources, C-CDA clinical summaries, CSV data extracts (older platforms), and supplemental text/PDF reports into a single ZIP file. The export covers all 7 EHI categories including billing transactions, insurance details, scheduling, provider-patient messages, and clinical documentation — making it one of the more complete EHI exports among major vendors. However, there is a significant documentation asymmetry: older platforms (C/S, MAGIC) have detailed field-level CSV data dictionaries covering 300+ tables, while the current Expanse platform lacks equivalent field-level documentation and exports some data (financial, authorization) as rendered text/PDF reports rather than structured data. The absence of comprehensive access audit trails is the most notable data gap.",

  "notes": "MEDITECH's approach of maintaining two export configurations creates complexity but reflects the reality of supporting multiple platform generations simultaneously. The older platforms paradoxically provide a more complete structured data export (CSV from the Data Repository) than the newer Expanse platform, which relies more on document-based export. The FHIR component (US Core STU 3.1.1 via Patient $everything) provides standard structured clinical data but by definition cannot cover billing, messaging, or audit data. The Table of Contents.ndjson using FHIR DocumentReference resources is a thoughtful touch for machine navigation of the export package. The export documentation site is clean, well-organized, and technically accessible — a model for how to publish EHI export documentation, even if the Expanse field-level detail is lacking."
