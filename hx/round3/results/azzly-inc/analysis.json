        "description": "AZZLY Rize is a cloud-based, all-in-one EHR, practice management, and revenue cycle management (RCM) platform built exclusively for behavioral health and addiction treatment organizations. It is hosted on Microsoft Azure and targets outpatient mental health, intensive outpatient programs, residential treatment centers, MAT/OTP programs, and telehealth-based behavioral health providers. The product includes clinical documentation (assessments, treatment plans, progress notes, outcome measurements like PHQ-9/GAD-7), e-prescribing with EPCS, PDMP integration, integrated billing/RCM with claims submission and clearinghouse integration, appointment scheduling with electronic check-in, a Patient Engagement Portal (PEP) with secure messaging, integrated Zoom telehealth, document management, a bed board for residential facilities, and withdrawal management modules. The certified module IS the product — AZZLY Rize is the only product from this vendor. However, the certification profile is remarkably limited: only (a)(12) Family Health History, (a)(15) Social/Behavioral Data, (b)(10) EHI Export, (e)(3) Patient Health Info Capture, plus security and general criteria. No core clinical criteria (a)(1)-(a)(9), no patient portal certification (e)(1), no FHIR API (g)(7)-(g)(10). This suggests minimum certification for CHPL listing.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The export is a vendor-mediated file delivery via Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. Users submit an 'Authorized User's Written Request' to AZZLY, who then uploads data files to an Azure Storage Container and provides a SAS (Shared Access Signature) URL. Users download Azure Storage Explorer to access the files. The data is organized into four folders: Clinical Data Forms (individual patient forms from eChart), Clinical Data Form Details (CSV listing every form with metadata), Data (structured CSV/Excel files with chart fields like allergies, diagnoses, medications, etc.), and Patients (photos and uploaded documents). This is a proprietary flat-file export — not database-native tables, not FHIR, not C-CDA. The documentation contradicts itself by stating users can export 'without developer assistance' while simultaneously requiring a written request and vendor-provided SAS URL.",

The description of actual export contents is limited to a single paragraph listing data category names (Allergies, Contact details, Diagnosis, Level of Care, Medications, Patient Communications, Patient Info, Insurance, Vitals 'etc.') with no field-level detail whatsoever. There is no data dictionary, no schema documentation, no field definitions, no data types, no value sets, no relationship documentation, and no examples. The 'etc.' at the end of the data categories list is particularly unhelpful — it implies additional data exists but is not documented.

The documentation is so sparse (listing only category names with no field detail) that it is impossible to assess true completeness. The Data folder covers 9 named categories: Allergies, Contact details, Diagnosis, Level of Care, Medications, Patient Communications, Patient Info, Insurance, and Vitals. Clinical forms from the eChart are exported as individual documents. Photos and uploaded documents are included. However, the product's core billing/RCM capabilities, scheduling system, e-prescribing records, PDMP queries, telehealth sessions, outcome measurements, withdrawal management data, and bed board information are all absent from the documentation. For a product that markets itself as 'all-in-one' EHR + practice management + RCM, exporting only clinical chart data represents a significant gap in EHI coverage.",

However, there is no explicit mention of problem lists, immunizations, procedures, lab results, family health history (despite (a)(12) certification), social/behavioral data (despite (a)(15) certification), or outcome measurement scores (PHQ-9, GAD-7).

  "summary": "AZZLY Rize is a behavioral health and addiction treatment EHR/RCM platform with a minimal 3-page EHI export documentation PDF. The export delivers CSV/Excel files via vendor-mediated Azure Blob Storage, covering basic clinical categories (allergies, diagnoses, medications, vitals, insurance, patient communications, clinical forms, photos/documents) but entirely omitting billing/financial data and scheduling — despite these being core product capabilities. The documentation provides zero field-level detail, listing only category names. The most significant gap is the complete absence of billing/RCM data from a product that markets integrated revenue cycle management as a primary feature.",

  "notes": "AZZLY Rize has an unusually limited ONC certification profile — only (a)(12), (a)(15), (b)(10), (e)(3) plus security/general criteria. No core clinical (a)(1)-(a)(9), no patient portal (e)(1), no FHIR API (g)(7)-(g)(10). This suggests the vendor pursued minimum certification to maintain CHPL listing rather than comprehensive certification of product capabilities. The product has significantly more functionality than what is certified, which makes the EHI export gap even more notable — the export should cover 'all EHI that can be stored by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part,' meaning all of AZZLY Rize's data, not just the certified features."
