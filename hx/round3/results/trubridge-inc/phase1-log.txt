Good! I can see:
- Two products: TruBridge EHR and TruBridge Provider EHR
- Both are version 22, certified Dec 2024
- Target market: "Inpatient and Ambulatory"
- Both have extensive certifications including clinical data (a)(1-5,12,14), transitions of care (b)(1-3), public health (f)(1,2,3,5), and API (g)(2-6)
- Both have (e)(3) which is patient-specific education resources

Let me start researching TruBridge. I'll browse their main website and certifications page.

Good, I see there's some info. From the research, I notice that "TruBridge Provider EHR" appears as a separate section in the EHR applications list, suggesting it's a distinct offering, likely focused on ambulatory/outpatient providers. Let me do a quick search to see if I can find more specifics about the differences.

Based on my research, I now have enough information to write the report. Let me compile what I've learned:

1. **TruBridge EHR** - Full hospital/inpatient EHR with extensive modules including LIS, RIS, pharmacy, OR management, home health, financial management, enterprise resource planning
2. **TruBridge Provider EHR** - Ambulatory-focused EHR with mobile rounding, practice management, clinical documentation
3. Both target rural and community hospitals/clinics
4. Also have **CHBase** and **InstantPHR** products mentioned in certifications

Now let me create the research documents.

With over 45 years of experience in the rural healthcare market, TruBridge provides comprehensive EHR systems, revenue cycle management, medical coding services, population health tools, and enterprise resource planning solutions. Their primary market is small to mid-sized hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and independent health systems that need integrated clinical and financial systems without the complexity and cost of large enterprise platforms.\n\nThe company offers a full suite of products covering the clinical, operational, and financial aspects of healthcare delivery. TruBridge emphasizes purpose-built solutions for resource-constrained settings, with 24/7 support and flexible deployment options. They serve hospitals, ambulatory practices, long-term care facilities, and specialty providers across the United States.\n\n---\n\n## Product: TruBridge EHR\n\nCHPL ID: 11541\nCertified Criteria: (a)(1-5, 12, 14); (b)(1-3, 10-11); (d)(1-9, 12-13); (e)(3); (f)(1-3, 5); (g)(2-6)\n\n### What It Is\n\nTruBridge EHR is a comprehensive, fully-integrated electronic health record and hospital information system designed for inpatient and ambulatory settings. It is marketed primarily to rural and community hospitals that need an all-in-one clinical, operational, and financial platform. The system supports inpatient care, emergency department workflows, surgical services, ancillary departments (lab, radiology, pharmacy), and enterprise functions including materials management, financial systems, and human resources.\n\nThe product is purpose-built for hospitals with limited IT staff and budgets, offering a complete suite of modules that would typically require multiple vendors in larger health systems. It emphasizes tight integration across clinical and business functions.\n\n### Data It Likely Stores\n\nBased on the product's extensive module list, TruBridge EHR stores a broad range of clinical, administrative, and financial data:\n\n**Clinical Data:**\n- Patient demographics and registration\n- Clinical documentation (physician notes, nursing documentation, multi-disciplinary notes)\n- Problem lists, diagnoses, and care plans\n- Medication lists, reconciliation, administration records (MAR), and e-prescribing\n- Laboratory orders and results (via integrated LIS)\n- Radiology orders and results (via integrated RIS), including mammography data\n- Vital signs and patient acuity measurements\n- Immunizations and allergies\n- Procedures and surgical records (OR management)\n- Blood administration and transfusion records\n- Physical therapy, cardiopulmonary, and rehabilitation documentation\n- Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI)\n- Resident Assessment Instruments (RAI) for skilled nursing facilities\n- Emergency department documentation\n- Order entry and results reporting\n- Clinical content libraries and patient education materials\n\n**Enterprise & Administrative Data:**\n- Scheduling (enterprise-wide scheduling module)\n- Document management (scanned documents, faxes via Auto-Fax)\n- Health Information Management (HIM) functions\n- Electronic forms and flowsheets\n- Interoperability data (CCD/CCDA exchange, interface messages)\n- Core Measures and CMS reporting data\n- Custom reports (ad hoc reporting via ODBC access)\n\n**Home Health:**\n- Home health administration and point-of-care documentation\n- Visit schedules and clinical assessments for home-based care\n\n**Financial & Operational Data:**\n- General ledger, budgeting, and financial reporting (Executive Information System)\n- Accounts payable, fixed assets, and electronic funds transfer\n- Materials management and inventory\n- Human resources, payroll/personnel, and time & attendance\n- Practice management / billing data (likely limited, as TruBridge offers separate RCM services)\n- Electronic purchase orders\n\n**Patient Portal & Engagement (via InstantPHR integration):**\n- Patient portal messages and secure communication\n- View/download/transmit (VDT) records\n- Patient-specific education resources (e)(3) certification\n\n### Notable Features Relevant to EHI\n\n**Integrated Ancillary Systems:** TruBridge EHR includes built-in Laboratory Information System (LIS), Radiology Information System (RIS), and pharmacy modules. This is significant because lab results, radiology reports, and pharmacy records are often stored in separate vendor systems. In TruBridge's case, this data is part of the core EHR database.\n\n**Enterprise Modules:** The product includes enterprise resource planning (ERP) functionality—general ledger, HR/payroll, materials management, and financial analytics. While most of this data is not \"EHI\" in the clinical sense, certain operational data (e.g., employee records related to care delivery, supply chain data) may intersect with patient care documentation.\n\n**Home Health:** The dedicated home health modules suggest that TruBridge EHR is used by hospitals that offer home health services or affiliated home health agencies. Home health assessments, visit notes, and care plans would be stored within the system.\n\n**InstantPHR Integration:** The certifications page lists \"InstantPHR® CEHRT Edition 20\" as a separate certified module that works with TruBridge EHR, Meditech Expanse, and AthenaOne. InstantPHR is TruBridge's patient portal and personal health record (PHR) platform. Patient portal messages, patient-generated data, and portal activity logs are likely stored in InstantPHR but associated with the EHR patient record.\n\n**Electronic Forms & Custom Content:** The product supports electronic forms and custom clinical content, meaning customer-specific forms, flowsheets, and documentation templates are part of the data model. Export completeness will depend on whether these custom forms are fully covered.\n\n**Interoperability Infrastructure:** TruBridge EHR includes an Interface Management System, Auto-Fax, and document exchange capabilities. This suggests that some clinical data may arrive via HL7 interfaces or document imports and may be stored as unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., scanned documents, faxed orders).\n\n**No Built-in Billing Detail (Likely Separate RCM):** While the EHR has \"practice management\" listed for the Provider EHR variant, the main TruBridge EHR appears focused on clinical and operational functions. TruBridge offers extensive Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services separately, which likely means billing/claims data is managed in a separate platform or module. The extent to which billing/claims data is part of the certified EHR vs. external RCM systems is unclear from the website.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://trubridge.com/\n- https://trubridge.com/solutions/electronic-health-record/\n- https://trubridge.com/certifications/\n- https://trubridge.com/who-we-serve/hospitals/\n- https://trubridge.com/company/about-us/\n\n---\n\n## Product: TruBridge Provider EHR\n\nCHPL ID: 11540\nCertified Criteria: (a)(1-5, 12, 14); (b)(1-3, 10-11); (d)(1-9, 12-13); (e)(3); (f)(1-2, 5); (g)(2-6)\n\n### What It Is\n\nTruBridge Provider EHR is an ambulatory-focused electronic medical record system designed for outpatient clinics, physician practices, and ambulatory care settings. It is a streamlined version or variant of the TruBridge EHR platform, emphasizing mobile access, efficient documentation, and practice management workflows for providers who primarily see patients in outpatient or clinic environments.\n\nThe product appears to be tailored for physicians and care teams who need quick charting, mobile rounding capabilities, and simplified order entry, without the full hospital information system (HIS) modules required for inpatient care. It is used by rural clinics, hospital-owned ambulatory practices, and independent provider groups.\n\n### Data It Likely Stores\n\nTruBridge Provider EHR stores ambulatory-focused clinical and practice management data:\n\n**Clinical Data:**\n- Patient demographics and registration\n- Physician documentation (progress notes, encounter documentation)\n- Problem lists, medications, allergies, and immunizations\n- Vital signs and clinical observations\n- Order entry (labs, imaging, referrals)\n- Results reporting (lab and radiology results)\n- E-prescribing (via DrFirst Gold integration for EPCS)\n- Clinical content and guidelines\n- Patient education materials (Truven Health Patient Education integration)\n- Care plans and treatment protocols\n- Inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care documentation (the product supports multiple care settings)\n\n**Practice Management:**\n- Scheduling and appointment management\n- Patient registration and insurance information\n- Encounter billing data (charges, diagnosis codes, procedure codes)\n- Practice workflow and patient flow tracking\n\n**Mobile & Remote Access:**\n- Mobile rounding documentation (provider notes entered on tablets/mobile devices)\n- Remote access logs and mobile documentation timestamps\n\n**Imaging & Diagnostics:**\n- ImageLink PACS integration suggests the product can store or link to medical imaging (X-rays, ultrasounds, etc.). It's unclear whether images are stored within the EHR database or referenced externally.\n\n**Patient Portal (via InstantPHR):**\n- Patient portal messages and secure communication\n- Patient-generated health data (if supported)\n- View/download/transmit records\n\n### Notable Features Relevant to EHI\n\n**Mobile Access & Mobile Rounding:** The product emphasizes mobile workflows, meaning documentation may occur on tablets or smartphones. Mobile-entered data (including timestamps, location metadata, or offline-synced notes) should be included in EHI exports.\n\n**Practice Management Integration:** Unlike the full TruBridge EHR (which has limited billing detail), TruBridge Provider EHR explicitly includes \"Practice Management\" as a key component. This suggests that scheduling, registration, and encounter-level billing data (charges, diagnosis codes) are tightly integrated. Whether detailed claims, remittance advice, or payment data are included is unclear.\n\n**Multi-Setting Support:** The product description states it supports \"inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care.\" This is notable because it suggests TruBridge Provider EHR may be used in hospital-owned clinics or mixed settings where providers round in both inpatient and outpatient areas. Clinical data may span multiple care settings.\n\n**Differences from TruBridge EHR:** The main TruBridge EHR has extensive ancillary modules (LIS, RIS, pharmacy, OR management, home health, enterprise financials). TruBridge Provider EHR does not list these modules explicitly, suggesting it is a lighter, provider-centric system. The certification criteria differ slightly: Provider EHR is certified for (f)(1-2, 5) but not (f)(3), which is Cancer Registry Reporting—suggesting it is not typically used in oncology specialty practices or hospital cancer registries.\n\n**ImageLink PACS:** Integration with a PACS suggests imaging data (or references to imaging studies) are part of the system. Whether actual images are stored in the EHR database or linked externally affects export scope.\n\n**ChartLink EHR Portal:** The main TruBridge EHR product lists \"ChartLink – EHR Portal\" as a physician access point. It's unclear if ChartLink is a separate physician-facing interface that TruBridge Provider EHR replaces or complements.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://trubridge.com/\n- https://trubridge.com/solutions/electronic-health-record/\n- https://trubridge.com/certifications/\n- https://trubridge.com/who-we-serve/hospitals/\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n**Related Products Not in CHPL Certification Scope:**\n\nDuring research, I found two additional certified products listed on the TruBridge certifications page that are **not** included in the provided CHPL metadata:\n\n- **CHBase™ CEHRT Edition 20** (CHPL ID 15.04.04.3104.CHBa.20.03.0.220819) — Certified for (b)(10), (d)(1-3, 5, 9, 12-13), (g)(1, 4-7, 9-10). This appears to be an interoperability/data exchange platform or middleware layer. It is not a full EHR but may serve as the backend for data aggregation, FHIR API access, or EHI export functionality.\n\n- **InstantPHR® CEHRT Edition 20** (CHPL ID 15.04.04.3104.Inst.20.02.0.190916) — Certified for (b)(10), (d)(1-3, 5-7, 9, 12-13), (e)(1, 3), (g)(1, 4-6). This is TruBridge's patient portal and personal health record platform. The certification listing notes it works with \"TruBridge EHR, Meditech Expanse, AthenaOne,\" indicating it is EHR-agnostic and can be paired with multiple backend EHR systems. InstantPHR stores patient portal messages, patient-generated data, and view/download/transmit interactions.\n\nThese products are **not part of the Phase 1 research scope** (CHPL IDs 11540 and 11541) but are part of TruBridge's broader product ecosystem and may be relevant to EHI export completeness if customers use them alongside TruBridge EHR or TruBridge Provider EHR.\n\n**Ecosystem & Integration:**\n\nTruBridge operates a multi-product ecosystem:\n- **EHR products** (TruBridge EHR, TruBridge Provider EHR) for clinical documentation\n- **Patient portal** (InstantPHR) for patient engagement\n- **Interoperability platform** (CHBase) for data exchange and APIs\n- **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services** — extensive outsourced billing, coding, and claims management services. It is unclear whether RCM data is stored in the certified EHR or in separate TruBridge-managed systems.\n- **Population Health & Data Management** — analytics and reporting tools (not part of the certified EHR scope)\n- **Enterprise Resource Planning** — financial and operational systems (included in TruBridge EHR but not clinical EHI)\n\nThe relationship between these products affects EHI export scope: if a customer uses TruBridge EHR + InstantPHR + external RCM, the EHI export may need to pull data from multiple systems.\n\n**Company Background:**\n\nTruBridge has been serving rural healthcare for 45+ years. The company name and product branding suggest a possible history of acquisitions or rebranding, but no specific acquisition history was found during this brief research. The InstantPHR certification listing mentions compatibility with \"Meditech Expanse, AthenaOne,\" indicating TruBridge also sells portal services to customers using other vendors' EHRs—this is not typical for most EHR vendors and suggests a flexible, multi-vendor interoperability strategy.\n"

## Overview

TruBridge, Inc. is a healthcare technology vendor focused on rural and community hospitals, as well as ambulatory practices and clinics. The company provides integrated healthcare revenue cycle management, EHR, and financial solutions designed to help healthcare organizations "improve margins, efficiency, and patient care."

The company targets healthcare providers ranging from "towns of 200 to cities of 200,000" and emphasizes serving smaller healthcare organizations that need comprehensive but affordable technology solutions. TruBridge offers a suite of integrated modules spanning clinical care, revenue cycle management, patient engagement, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and population health.

The "Thri" abbreviation in the CHPL product numbers (15.04.04.3104.Thri.*) suggests the products may have been previously associated with Thrive Health Management or a similar predecessor, though current branding is entirely TruBridge.

## Product: TruBridge EHR / TruBridge Provider EHR

CHPL IDs: 11540 (Provider EHR), 11541 (EHR)

### What It Is

TruBridge offers two certified EHR products that appear to be variants of the same platform:
- **TruBridge Provider EHR** (CHPL ID 11540)
- **TruBridge EHR** (CHPL ID 11541)

Both are version 22, certified in December 2024. The distinction between "Provider EHR" and "EHR" is not clear from public documentation, but the nearly identical certification criteria suggest they share the same underlying platform, possibly differentiated by deployment model, feature set, or target setting (ambulatory vs. inpatient).

The EHR is described as containing "integrated applications that span all clinical, administrative, and financial areas." It's designed for both inpatient (hospital) and ambulatory (clinic) settings, as indicated by the CHPL metadata field `sed_intended_user_description: "Inpatient and Ambulatory"`.

The products have comprehensive ONC certifications across 30+ criteria, including:
- **Clinical data capture**: Demographics (a)(1), CPOE medications (a)(2), CPOE labs/imaging (a)(3), drug-drug/drug-allergy checks (a)(4), clinical decision support (a)(5), clinical quality measures (a)(14), clinical information reconciliation (a)(12)
- **Transitions of care**: C-CDA creation/receipt/transmission (b)(1), (b)(2), and electronic prescribing (b)(3)
- **Patient engagement**: View/download/transmit (e)(3)
- **Public health**: Immunization reporting (f)(1), syndromic surveillance (f)(2), and (for the main EHR product) electronic case reporting (f)(3)
- **API access**: Patient services API (g)(10) and associated security/authorization (g) criteria
- **Privacy and security**: Extensive (d) criteria including encryption, authentication, audit logs, etc.

This certification profile is typical of a full-featured EHR system that handles end-to-end clinical and administrative workflows.

### Data It Likely Stores

Based on the certifications, website descriptions, and target market, TruBridge EHR likely stores:

**Clinical Records**
- Patient demographics, problem lists, medication lists, allergy lists
- Clinical notes and documentation
- Orders (medications, labs, imaging, procedures)
- Laboratory and diagnostic test results
- Vital signs and other measurements
- Clinical quality measure data
- Clinical decision support interventions and alerts
- Care plan information and clinical information reconciliation (medication/allergy/problem list reconciliation)
- Immunization records

**Billing and Revenue Cycle**
- Charges, claims, and billing transactions
- Insurance and payer information
- Payment and adjustment records
- Revenue cycle management data (the company explicitly markets RCM as integrated with the EHR)
- Medical coding data (TruBridge offers "Medical Coding Technology & Services" as part of their suite)

**Scheduling and Registration**

Hmm, interesting. The files I just created are untracked. Let me check what's in the trubridge directory:

Wait, this shows the commit exists. Let me check the actual content on disk vs. what was committed:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && cat results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md | head -5"
}
[RESULT: # TruBridge, Inc. — Product Research

The researched date says "2026-02-14" which is wrong - I set it to "2025-01-16". Let me check what got committed:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && git show HEAD:results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md | head -5"
}
[RESULT: # TruBridge, Inc. — Product Research

Researched: 2026-02-14
Developer website: https://trubridge.com/

]
I see - the overwrite didn't work as expected. There must have been a pre-existing file. Let me check if my new content actually wrote or if the old content is still there:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && git show HEAD:results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md | grep -c \"TruBridge Provider EHR\""
}
[RESULT: 2
]

[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && git show HEAD:results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md | grep -A5 \"## Product: TruBridge Provider EHR\""
}
[TOOL ERROR]
[RESULT: [command failed: exit status 1]
]

[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && git show HEAD:results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md | grep \"Product:\""
}
[RESULT: ## Product: TruBridge EHR / TruBridge Provider EHR
]
Ah! The old file had them combined as "TruBridge EHR / TruBridge Provider EHR". My new version separates them into two distinct products. It looks like there was already a pre-existing file, and when I used the patch tool with "overwrite", it may not have overwritten properly. Let me check the actual current content and verify it matches what I intended:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && cat results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md | grep \"^## Product\""
}
[RESULT: ## Product: TruBridge EHR / TruBridge Provider EHR
]
So it seems my overwrite command wrote the OLD content, not my new content! Let me check what actually got committed in the last commit by looking at the diff properly:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && git show 9a850c4 --stat"
}

So this is the first and only commit for these files. It seems like what happened is:

1. The files didn't exist in git before
2. They did exist on disk (from a previous research session)
3. When I used the patch tool with "overwrite", it may have read the existing file instead of overwriting with my new content
4. Then I committed what was already on disk

Let me verify the content is actually good by checking a key section:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && cat results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md | grep -A20 \"^### Data It Likely Stores\" | head -25"
}
[RESULT: ### Data It Likely Stores

Based on the certifications, website descriptions, and target market, TruBridge EHR likely stores:

**Clinical Records**
- Patient demographics, problem lists, medication lists, allergy lists
- Clinical notes and documentation
- Orders (medications, labs, imaging, procedures)
- Laboratory and diagnostic test results
- Vital signs and other measurements
- Clinical quality measure data
- Clinical decision support interventions and alerts
- Care plan information and clinical information reconciliation (medication/allergy/problem list reconciliation)
- Immunization records

**Billing and Revenue Cycle**
- Charges, claims, and billing transactions
- Insurance and payer information
- Payment and adjustment records
- Revenue cycle management data (the company explicitly markets RCM as integrated with the EHR)
- Medical coding data (TruBridge offers "Medical Coding Technology & Services" as part of their suite)
]
Actually, this looks like it might be a reasonable older version. The content is different from what I wrote, but it's not wrong. Let me see if it actually covers the key points I was trying to make. Let me check the JSON too:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && cat results/trubridge-inc/product-research.json | jq '.products[] | .name'"
}
[RESULT: "TruBridge EHR Platform"
]
So the current committed version treats them as ONE product ("TruBridge EHR Platform"), not two. My research found they should be TWO separate products. Let me rewrite both files properly:
[TOOL: bash]
{
  "command": "cd /home/exedev/EHI && rm results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md results/trubridge-inc/product-research.json"
}
Now let me create them fresh:
[TOOL: patch]
{
  "path": "/home/exedev/EHI/results/trubridge-inc/product-research.md",
  "patches": [
    {
      "operation": "overwrite",
      "newText": "# TruBridge, Inc. — Product Research\n\nResearched: 2025-01-16\nDeveloper website: https://trubridge.com/\n\n## Overview\n\nTruBridge, Inc. is a healthcare technology and services company specializing in solutions for rural and community hospitals and health systems. With over 45 years of experience in the rural healthcare market, TruBridge provides comprehensive EHR systems, revenue cycle management, medical coding services, population health tools, and enterprise resource planning solutions. Their primary market is small to mid-sized hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and independent health systems that need integrated clinical and financial systems without the complexity and cost of large enterprise platforms.\n\nThe company offers a full suite of products covering the clinical, operational, and financial aspects of healthcare delivery. TruBridge emphasizes purpose-built solutions for resource-constrained settings, with 24/7 support and flexible deployment options. They serve hospitals, ambulatory practices, long-term care facilities, and specialty providers across the United States.\n\n---\n\n## Product: TruBridge EHR\n\nCHPL ID: 11541\nCertified Criteria: (a)(1-5, 12, 14); (b)(1-3, 10-11); (d)(1-9, 12-13); (e)(3); (f)(1-3, 5); (g)(2-6)\n\n### What It Is\n\nTruBridge EHR is a comprehensive, fully-integrated electronic health record and hospital information system designed for inpatient and ambulatory settings. It is marketed primarily to rural and community hospitals that need an all-in-one clinical, operational, and financial platform. The system supports inpatient care, emergency department workflows, surgical services, ancillary departments (lab, radiology, pharmacy), and enterprise functions including materials management, financial systems, and human resources.\n\nThe product is purpose-built for hospitals with limited IT staff and budgets, offering a complete suite of modules that would typically require multiple vendors in larger health systems. It emphasizes tight integration across clinical and business functions.\n\n### Data It Likely Stores\n\nBased on the product's extensive module list, TruBridge EHR stores a broad range of clinical, administrative, and financial data:\n\n**Clinical Data:**\n- Patient demographics and registration\n- Clinical documentation (physician notes, nursing documentation, multi-disciplinary notes)\n- Problem lists, diagnoses, and care plans\n- Medication lists, reconciliation, administration records (MAR), and e-prescribing\n- Laboratory orders and results (via integrated LIS)\n- Radiology orders and results (via integrated RIS), including mammography data\n- Vital signs and patient acuity measurements\n- Immunizations and allergies\n- Procedures and surgical records (OR management)\n- Blood administration and transfusion records\n- Physical therapy, cardiopulmonary, and rehabilitation documentation\n- Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI)\n- Resident Assessment Instruments (RAI) for skilled nursing facilities\n- Emergency department documentation\n- Order entry and results reporting\n- Clinical content libraries and patient education materials\n\n**Enterprise & Administrative Data:**\n- Scheduling (enterprise-wide scheduling module)\n- Document management (scanned documents, faxes via Auto-Fax)\n- Health Information Management (HIM) functions\n- Electronic forms and flowsheets\n- Interoperability data (CCD/CCDA exchange, interface messages)\n- Core Measures and CMS reporting data\n- Custom reports (ad hoc reporting via ODBC access)\n\n**Home Health:**\n- Home health administration and point-of-care documentation\n- Visit schedules and clinical assessments for home-based care\n\n**Financial & Operational Data:**\n- General ledger, budgeting, and financial reporting (Executive Information System)\n- Accounts payable, fixed assets, and electronic funds transfer\n- Materials management and inventory\n- Human resources, payroll/personnel, and time & attendance\n- Practice management / billing data (likely limited, as TruBridge offers separate RCM services)\n- Electronic purchase orders\n\n**Patient Portal & Engagement (via InstantPHR integration):**\n- Patient portal messages and secure communication\n- View/download/transmit (VDT) records\n- Patient-specific education resources (e)(3) certification\n\n### Notable Features Relevant to EHI\n\n**Integrated Ancillary Systems:** TruBridge EHR includes built-in Laboratory Information System (LIS), Radiology Information System (RIS), and pharmacy modules. This is significant because lab results, radiology reports, and pharmacy records are often stored in separate vendor systems. In TruBridge's case, this data is part of the core EHR database.\n\n**Enterprise Modules:** The product includes enterprise resource planning (ERP) functionality—general ledger, HR/payroll, materials management, and financial analytics. While most of this data is not \"EHI\" in the clinical sense, certain operational data (e.g., employee records related to care delivery, supply chain data) may intersect with patient care documentation.\n\n**Home Health:** The dedicated home health modules suggest that TruBridge EHR is used by hospitals that offer home health services or affiliated home health agencies. Home health assessments, visit notes, and care plans would be stored within the system.\n\n**InstantPHR Integration:** The certifications page lists \"InstantPHR® CEHRT Edition 20\" as a separate certified module that works with TruBridge EHR, Meditech Expanse, and AthenaOne. InstantPHR is TruBridge's patient portal and personal health record (PHR) platform. Patient portal messages, patient-generated data, and portal activity logs are likely stored in InstantPHR but associated with the EHR patient record.\n\n**Electronic Forms & Custom Content:** The product supports electronic forms and custom clinical content, meaning customer-specific forms, flowsheets, and documentation templates are part of the data model. Export completeness will depend on whether these custom forms are fully covered.\n\n**Interoperability Infrastructure:** TruBridge EHR includes an Interface Management System, Auto-Fax, and document exchange capabilities. This suggests that some clinical data may arrive via HL7 interfaces or document imports and may be stored as unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., scanned documents, faxed orders).\n\n**No Built-in Billing Detail (Likely Separate RCM):** While the EHR has \"practice management\" listed for the Provider EHR variant, the main TruBridge EHR appears focused on clinical and operational functions. TruBridge offers extensive Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services separately, which likely means billing/claims data is managed in a separate platform or module. The extent to which billing/claims data is part of the certified EHR vs. external RCM systems is unclear from the website.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://trubridge.com/\n- https://trubridge.com/solutions/electronic-health-record/\n- https://trubridge.com/certifications/\n- https://trubridge.com/who-we-serve/hospitals/\n- https://trubridge.com/company/about-us/\n\n---\n\n## Product: TruBridge Provider EHR\n\nCHPL ID: 11540\nCertified Criteria: (a)(1-5, 12, 14); (b)(1-3, 10-11); (d)(1-9, 12-13); (e)(3); (f)(1-2, 5); (g)(2-6)\n\n### What It Is\n\nTruBridge Provider EHR is an ambulatory-focused electronic medical record system designed for outpatient clinics, physician practices, and ambulatory care settings. It is a streamlined version or variant of the TruBridge EHR platform, emphasizing mobile access, efficient documentation, and practice management workflows for providers who primarily see patients in outpatient or clinic environments.\n\nThe product appears to be tailored for physicians and care teams who need quick charting, mobile rounding capabilities, and simplified order entry, without the full hospital information system (HIS) modules required for inpatient care. It is used by rural clinics, hospital-owned ambulatory practices, and independent provider groups.\n\n### Data It Likely Stores\n\nTruBridge Provider EHR stores ambulatory-focused clinical and practice management data:\n\n**Clinical Data:**\n- Patient demographics and registration\n- Physician documentation (progress notes, encounter documentation)\n- Problem lists, medications, allergies, and immunizations\n- Vital signs and clinical observations\n- Order entry (labs, imaging, referrals)\n- Results reporting (lab and radiology results)\n- E-prescribing (via DrFirst Gold integration for EPCS)\n- Clinical content and guidelines\n- Patient education materials (Truven Health Patient Education integration)\n- Care plans and treatment protocols\n- Inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care documentation (the product supports multiple care settings)\n\n**Practice Management:**\n- Scheduling and appointment management\n- Patient registration and insurance information\n- Encounter billing data (charges, diagnosis codes, procedure codes)\n- Practice workflow and patient flow tracking\n\n**Mobile & Remote Access:**\n- Mobile rounding documentation (provider notes entered on tablets/mobile devices)\n- Remote access logs and mobile documentation timestamps\n\n**Imaging & Diagnostics:**\n- ImageLink PACS integration suggests the product can store or link to medical imaging (X-rays, ultrasounds, etc.). It's unclear whether images are stored within the EHR database or referenced externally.\n\n**Patient Portal (via InstantPHR):**\n- Patient portal messages and secure communication\n- Patient-generated health data (if supported)\n- View/download/transmit records\n\n### Notable Features Relevant to EHI\n\n**Mobile Access & Mobile Rounding:** The product emphasizes mobile workflows, meaning documentation may occur on tablets or smartphones. Mobile-entered data (including timestamps, location metadata, or offline-synced notes) should be included in EHI exports.\n\n**Practice Management Integration:** Unlike the full TruBridge EHR (which has limited billing detail), TruBridge Provider EHR explicitly includes \"Practice Management\" as a key component. This suggests that scheduling, registration, and encounter-level billing data (charges, diagnosis codes) are tightly integrated. Whether detailed claims, remittance advice, or payment data are included is unclear.\n\n**Multi-Setting Support:** The product description states it supports \"inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care.\" This is notable because it suggests TruBridge Provider EHR may be used in hospital-owned clinics or mixed settings where providers round in both inpatient and outpatient areas. Clinical data may span multiple care settings.\n\n**Differences from TruBridge EHR:** The main TruBridge EHR has extensive ancillary modules (LIS, RIS, pharmacy, OR management, home health, enterprise financials). TruBridge Provider EHR does not list these modules explicitly, suggesting it is a lighter, provider-centric system. The certification criteria differ slightly: Provider EHR is certified for (f)(1-2, 5) but not (f)(3), which is Cancer Registry Reporting—suggesting it is not typically used in oncology specialty practices or hospital cancer registries.\n\n**ImageLink PACS:** Integration with a PACS suggests imaging data (or references to imaging studies) are part of the system. Whether actual images are stored in the EHR database or linked externally affects export scope.\n\n**ChartLink EHR Portal:** The main TruBridge EHR product lists \"ChartLink – EHR Portal\" as a physician access point. It's unclear if ChartLink is a separate physician-facing interface that TruBridge Provider EHR replaces or complements.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://trubridge.com/\n- https://trubridge.com/solutions/electronic-health-record/\n- https://trubridge.com/certifications/\n- https://trubridge.com/who-we-serve/hospitals/\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n**Related Products Not in CHPL Certification Scope:**\n\nDuring research, I found two additional certified products listed on the TruBridge certifications page that are **not** included in the provided CHPL metadata:\n\n- **CHBase™ CEHRT Edition 20** (CHPL ID 15.04.04.3104.CHBa.20.03.0.220819) — Certified for (b)(10), (d)(1-3, 5, 9, 12-13), (g)(1, 4-7, 9-10). This appears to be an interoperability/data exchange platform or middleware layer. It is not a full EHR but may serve as the backend for data aggregation, FHIR API access, or EHI export functionality.\n\n- **InstantPHR® CEHRT Edition 20** (CHPL ID 15.04.04.3104.Inst.20.02.0.190916) — Certified for (b)(10), (d)(1-3, 5-7, 9, 12-13), (e)(1, 3), (g)(1, 4-6). This is TruBridge's patient portal and personal health record platform. The certification listing notes it works with \"TruBridge EHR, Meditech Expanse, AthenaOne,\" indicating it is EHR-agnostic and can be paired with multiple backend EHR systems. InstantPHR stores patient portal messages, patient-generated data, and view/download/transmit interactions.\n\nThese products are **not part of the Phase 1 research scope** (CHPL IDs 11540 and 11541) but are part of TruBridge's broader product ecosystem and may be relevant to EHI export completeness if customers use them alongside TruBridge EHR or TruBridge Provider EHR.\n\n**Ecosystem & Integration:**\n\nTruBridge operates a multi-product ecosystem:\n- **EHR products** (TruBridge EHR, TruBridge Provider EHR) for clinical documentation\n- **Patient portal** (InstantPHR) for patient engagement\n- **Interoperability platform** (CHBase) for data exchange and APIs\n- **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services** — extensive outsourced billing, coding, and claims management services. It is unclear whether RCM data is stored in the certified EHR or in separate TruBridge-managed systems.\n- **Population Health & Data Management** — analytics and reporting tools (not part of the certified EHR scope)\n- **Enterprise Resource Planning** — financial and operational systems (included in TruBridge EHR but not clinical EHI)\n\nThe relationship between these products affects EHI export scope: if a customer uses TruBridge EHR + InstantPHR + external RCM, the EHI export may need to pull data from multiple systems.\n\n**Company Background:**\n\nTruBridge has been serving rural healthcare for 45+ years. The company name and product branding suggest a possible history of acquisitions or rebranding, but no specific acquisition history was found during this brief research. The InstantPHR certification listing mentions compatibility with \"Meditech Expanse, AthenaOne,\" indicating TruBridge also sells portal services to customers using other vendors' EHRs—this is not typical for most EHR vendors and suggests a flexible, multi-vendor interoperability strategy.\n"
