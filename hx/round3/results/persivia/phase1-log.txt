## Bottom Line Classification

**Persivia Platform / CareSpace® is NOT a traditional EHR.** It is an **AI-driven population health management, care coordination, data aggregation, and analytics platform** that:
1. Aggregates data from multiple EHRs and other sources into a unified longitudinal record
2. Applies AI/ML/NLP to generate actionable clinical insights
3. Delivers those insights back to providers at the point of care (embedded in their existing EHR)
4. Manages quality reporting, risk adjustment, care management workflows, and value-based care programs

It obtained ONC certification for specific Health IT modules (clinical data management, CDS, quality measures, APIs, transitions of care) but its primary identity is as a **population health and value-based care platform**, not a primary EHR for charting/order entry.]

[RESULT: Subagent 'research2' response:
[Subagent is still working (timeout reached). Progress summary:]
The subagent attempted to fetch content from multiple Persivia product pages (CareSpace, Provider Engagement, Care Management, Patient Engagement, Data Aggregation) using both curl and a browser, but encountered significant difficulties — the site appears to use heavy JavaScript rendering (Elementor), and most pages returned empty or minimal HTML content. The care-management and patient-engagement pages returned some raw metadata/descriptions via curl, but the HTML stripping didn't extract usable body content. The subagent was still troubleshooting how to successfully retrieve page content when the timeout was reached, and had not yet produced any summaries of the pages' information. It appears stuck on the content retrieval step and may need an alternative approach, such as using a fully JavaScript-capable headless browser with proper wait conditions, or relying on cached/archived versions of these pages.]

CareSpace® is an amazingly effective product. We have tried numerous population health management tools and none come close to the capabilities of CareSpace®. Our care managers love the system. We were able to go from contract signing to live in under 30 days. Persivia implemented our custom forms and workflows in about a week and our care managers were trained in one day. Combined with CareSpace®’s deep analytics capabilities we have the perfect tool to manage all these programs.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has worked with iterations of smartLab for 15 years, which is testament to how well it works. All Massachusetts clinical facilities and the major commercial laboratories route electronic laboratory results through the interface. We worked with Persivia to have the interface certified for Meaningful Use Stages 1, 2 and 3 (Promoting Interoperability). The product has proven to be both stable and flexible, and Persivia offers excellent support. During the pandemic, smartLab has coped very well with an order of magnitude increase in throughput. We are currently expanding the platform to process electronic case reports and installing an analytical dashboard.

smartLab™ has allowed the Iowa Department of Public Health to create a nimble and highly scale-able process across Iowa. Over the years we have been operating SmartLab™. The platform has performed flawlessly, and we are very happy with the support we have received from Persivia. smartLab™ is a uniquely powerful product. I think every DPH in the country would benefit from using smartLab™ to be able to effectively respond to large scale threats to public health like COVID-19. Recently, Iowa was able to update the smartLab™ for COVID-19 within about 30 minutes, notify reporting partners, and within a few hours, some of those partners were ready to report electronically through smartLab™

The company builds CareSpace®, an AI-driven population health management and care coordination platform designed to help healthcare organizations succeed in value-based care (VBC) models. Persivia is **not a traditional EHR vendor** — its platform sits alongside and integrates with existing EHRs (80+ supported), aggregating clinical, claims, and other data into a unified longitudinal patient record, then applying AI/ML/NLP to generate actionable insights for providers and care managers.\n\nPersivia serves a diverse customer base: ACOs, physician groups, hospitals and health systems, Medicare Advantage plans, payers, employers, and state public health departments. The company claims to support 200+ hospitals, 1,200+ users, and 20M+ patients across 180M+ encounters. Notable customers include McLaren Physician Partners, Prime Healthcare, St. John's Riverside Hospital, and the Massachusetts and Iowa Departments of Public Health. Persivia is Gartner-recognized for Health Data Management, AI-enabled Solutions, and Population Health.\n\n---\n\n## Product: Persivia Platform (CareSpace®)\n\nCHPL IDs: 10918 (v4.0), 11149 (v3.5)\n\n### What It Is\n\nThe Persivia Platform, branded as **CareSpace®**, is an end-to-end AI-driven digital health platform focused on population health management, care coordination, quality reporting, and risk adjustment. It is **not a primary EHR** for clinical charting or order entry — rather, it integrates bi-directionally with the provider's existing EHR(s) and layers on population health capabilities.\n\nThe platform consists of several key components:\n\n1. **CareSpace®** — The overarching Population Health Cloud platform and care management workbench\n2. **Data Cloud** — A lakehouse-based data aggregation and management layer that builds a Unified Data Model (UDM) from multiple sources\n3. **Persivia CareTrak®** — An EHR-agnostic point-of-care tool that embeds inside provider EHRs via single sign-on, delivering alerts, care gaps, HCC coding suggestions, and a full patient view\n4. **Soliton®** — The proprietary AI engine powering predictive analytics, NLP, and ML across all modules\n5. **SmartLab™** — An Electronic Test Orders & Results (ETOR) system used by hospitals, labs, and state public health departments (in production with MA DPH and Iowa DPH for 15+ years)\n\nThe platform has two ONC-certified versions:\n- **v4.0** (CHPL 10918): Certified for a narrower set — CDS criteria (c)(1-3), EHI export (b)(10), and supporting (d)/(g) criteria. Appears focused on CDS and quality measures.\n- **v3.5** (CHPL 11149): Certified for a broader set including clinical data (a)(1-2, 5, 12, 14), transitions of care (b)(1), clinical information reconciliation (b)(11), CDS (c)(1-4), FHIR APIs (g)(7, 9), and direct messaging (h)(1). This version has meaningful clinical data management certification.\n\nTarget users include care managers, quality managers, CDI teams, physicians (via CareTrak embedded in their EHR), population health analysts, and risk adjustment coders.\n\n### Data It Likely Stores\n\nPersivia's platform is fundamentally a **data aggregation and analytics system**, which means it ingests, normalizes, and stores large volumes of patient data from many sources. The Unified Data Model (UDM) builds a Longitudinal Patient Record (LPR) per patient from:\n\n**Clinical data (aggregated from EHRs and other sources):**\n- Patient demographics\n- Diagnoses / problem lists\n- Medications / medication lists\n- Allergies\n- Lab results (both aggregated from EHRs and directly via SmartLab ETOR)\n- Vitals\n- Clinical notes / unstructured text (processed by NLP)\n- Immunizations\n- Procedures\n\n**Claims and administrative data:**\n- Claims data (from payers/clearinghouses)\n- Eligibility information\n- Administrative data\n\n**Care management data (created within CareSpace):**\n- Care plans and goals\n- Care pathways (200+ built-in evidence-based pathways)\n- Care management workflows and tasks\n- Assessments (custom forms, SDOH screenings)\n- Care coordination notes\n- Transitions of care records\n- Referral tracking\n\n**Quality and risk data:**\n- eCQM measure calculations and submissions (MIPS, MSSP, ACO REACH, HEDIS, etc.)\n- HCC/RAF risk adjustment coding (NLP-extracted from notes, claimed 98% accuracy)\n- Quality gaps and care gaps\n- Risk stratification scores\n- Predictive cost models\n\n**Patient engagement data:**\n- Patient portal activity\n- Patient-reported data (via patient app — Android & iOS)\n- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) data from 300+ home devices\n- Messaging (bidirectional — text, audio, video between patients and care teams)\n- Appointment scheduling\n- Automated reminders and nudges\n\n**Public health reporting data:**\n- Lab orders and results (SmartLab — HL7 2.3.1/2.5.1)\n- Electronic case reports\n- Syndromic surveillance data\n\n**HIE / real-time feeds:**\n- ADT (admission/discharge/transfer) notifications from HIEs\n- SDOH (Social Determinants of Health) data\n\n### Notable Features Relevant to EHI\n\n1. **Data aggregation is the core function.** The platform ingests and stores data from potentially dozens of EHRs and other systems per customer. The LPR (Longitudinal Patient Record) may contain far more data than any single source system. This raises the question: does the EHI export include all aggregated data, or only data originating within CareSpace itself?\n\n2. **Care management workflows create original data.** Care plans, tasks, assessments, care coordination notes, and custom forms are created natively within CareSpace — these are not aggregated from EHRs. This data must appear in EHI exports.\n\n3. **Patient engagement / messaging.** CareSpace includes a patient portal, patient app, and bidirectional messaging (text/audio/video). Messages and patient-reported data are original to the platform.\n\n4. **Quality and risk adjustment calculations.** HCC codes extracted by NLP, quality measure calculations, risk scores, and care gaps are generated by the platform. Whether these derived/calculated data are \"electronic health information\" for export purposes is an interesting question.\n\n5. **EHI export format is XML/CCD (QRDA Cat I).** The mandatory disclosure page says v4.0 exports in QRDA Cat I XML format, and v3.5 exports as \"XML-based CCD file.\" Both QRDA Cat I and CCD are structured clinical document formats with limited scope — they typically capture the USCDI/C-CDA data elements (demographics, problems, meds, allergies, vitals, labs, procedures, etc.) but would NOT capture care management notes, messaging, custom assessments, quality calculations, risk scores, claims data, RPM data, or other platform-specific data. This is a significant potential gap.\n\n6. **SmartLab (ETOR) is a distinct sub-product** used by state public health departments for lab reporting. It has its own data (lab orders/results) that may or may not be included in the platform-level EHI export.\n\n7. **Custom forms and workflows.** Persivia mentions implementing \"custom forms and workflows\" for customers (one testimonial mentions custom forms deployed in about a week). Data captured via custom forms would need to be in the EHI export.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://persivia.com/ — Main homepage / product overview\n- https://persivia.com/our-story/ — Company history and mission\n- https://persivia.com/patient-engagement/ — Patient engagement features\n- https://persivia.com/meaningful-use-certification-language/ — ONC certification disclosures and EHI export documentation\n- Customer testimonials on homepage (McLaren Physician Partners, Prime Healthcare, St. John's Riverside Hospital, MA DPH, Iowa DPH)\n"

Done. Here's a summary of the key findings:

## Persivia — Research Summary

**Persivia is NOT a traditional EHR.** It's an AI-driven population health management and care coordination platform called **CareSpace®** that sits alongside existing EHRs.

**Key facts:**
- Founded 2015, Marlborough, MA
- Integrates bi-directionally with **80+ EHRs** — aggregates data rather than originating clinical records
- Serves ACOs, physician groups, hospitals, payers, Medicare Advantage, and state public health departments
- 200+ hospitals, 20M+ patients

**Platform components:**
- **CareSpace** — Population health cloud / care management workbench
- **CareTrak** — Point-of-care tool embedded in existing EHRs
- **SmartLab/ETOR** — Lab order/result exchange (used by MA & Iowa DPH for 15+ years)
- **Soliton** — AI engine (NLP, ML, predictive analytics)
- **Data Cloud** — Lakehouse data aggregation layer

**Data domains are extensive:** aggregated clinical records from multiple EHRs, care management plans/workflows, quality measure calculations (eCQM/MIPS/HEDIS), HCC/risk adjustment codes, patient portal/messaging, RPM from 300+ home devices, claims data, SDOH, ADT notifications, custom forms, and predictive analytics.

**Key EHI concern:** The EHI export uses **XML/CCD and QRDA Cat I** formats, which are structured clinical document formats with limited scope. They likely can't capture care management notes, messaging, custom assessments, quality calculations, risk scores, claims data, RPM data, or other platform-specific data — yet these are all "electronic health information that can be stored" by the product.
