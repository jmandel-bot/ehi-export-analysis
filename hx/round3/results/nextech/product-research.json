  "notes": "Nextech appears to have multiple product lines (SRS, IntelleChartPRO/ICP, Nextech Select/NexCloud) with unclear relationships. Both certified products serve the same five specialties (dermatology, ophthalmology, plastic surgery, orthopedics, med spa), so product differentiation is likely based on platform generation, deployment model, or feature sets rather than specialty focus. Nextech emphasizes integrated EHR + practice management with revenue cycle, patient engagement, and specialty-specific workflows. As a specialty EHR vendor, they likely have deep specialty-specific features (e.g., ophthalmology refractions/glaucoma tracking, dermatology body diagrams, plastic surgery photo management, cosmetic treatment packages) that may or may not be fully represented in generic export folder structures. Company recognized as '2024 Best in KLAS: Ambulatory Specialty EHR' and holds AAD DataDerm Gold Recognition. Recently promoted AI Scribe (Cora Scribe) for clinical documentation - storage/integration of AI-generated content unclear."
