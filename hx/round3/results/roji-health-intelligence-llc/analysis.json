        "description": "Roji Clinical Data Registry is NOT an EHR. It is a CMS-approved Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) and quality reporting analytics platform delivered as SaaS. The company (formerly ICLOPS, founded 2002) has been a CMS-qualified registry since 2008. The product aggregates clinical data from existing EHR systems (via flat files, FHIR, HL7, and custom formats) into a patient-centric database for quality measure calculation/reporting (MIPS, MVPs, APP, ACOs), episode-of-care cost analysis, population health analytics, and provider benchmarking. It is used by ACOs, health systems, and medical groups that already have their own EHR systems — it is a secondary analytics layer, not a primary system of record for clinical care. The certified criteria (c)(2)-(c)(4) for CQM import/calculate/report/filter confirm its core function. It has no patient portal, no billing/RCM system, no scheduling, and no document management. The product stores aggregated clinical data points, quality measure results, claims-derived cost/utilization data, and patient demographics — not full clinical records.",

        "description": "The EHI export is a native JSON export of the registry's patient-level data. The vendor states: 'Single patient and population exports are available free of charge for users with patient level access in JSON format.' The data dictionary is a JSON Schema (draft-07) document describing a PatientData object with sections for Demographics, QualityMeasures, PatientRisk, Conditions, UtilizationProvider, Episodes (with cost data), HistoryClaims, Immunizations, Outcomes, and Medications. This is a database-native export of the aggregated registry data — not FHIR, not C-CDA. The export is appropriate for this product's scope: it exports the quality/analytics data the registry stores, which is itself derived from upstream EHR data.",

Several fields have empty schemas (Medications, Populations, Race, Ethnicity, etc.) with no type defined. The schema contains typos ('Taxomomy', 'Complience').

        "overall_assessment": "The export covers the data this specific product stores, which is quality registry and analytics data — not comprehensive clinical EHR data. The product is a QCDR that aggregates data from upstream EHR systems for quality reporting and cost analysis. Its export includes demographics, quality measure results, risk scores, conditions, claims history (diagnosis/procedure codes), immunizations, outcomes, utilization data, and episode-of-care cost analytics. This is appropriate for the product's scope — the b(10) requirement covers 'all EHI that can be stored by the product,' and this product stores registry/analytics data, not primary clinical records. Major categories like secure messages, scheduling, document management, and detailed billing are absent, but the product does not have these capabilities. The main concern is whether the export fully covers what the product stores — the empty Medications and Populations schemas suggest possible gaps even within its own data model.",

  "notes": "The registered CHPL URL (/costs-and-limitations/) was renamed to /costs-and-requirements/ via a 301 redirect, likely around September 2024 based on Wayback Machine records. The mandatory_disclosures_url in the CHPL metadata already points to the new URL, but the b(10) export documentation URL still references the old path. The Wayback Machine shows the old URL was active from 2019 through at least 2024. The data dictionary file had only one Wayback snapshot (April 2024), suggesting it may have been accessible for a limited time. The product's certification dates to February 2017 and participates in annual Real World Testing through Drummond."
