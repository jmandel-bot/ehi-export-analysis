      "product_context": {
        "description": "ERMA (Electronic Records Management Application) is a proprietary, web-based EHR system developed and used exclusively by Wellpath, one of the largest correctional healthcare companies in the US. Wellpath provides contracted healthcare at 315+ correctional facilities in 37 states, serving ~200,000 patients daily. ERMA is not sold externally — it exists only within Wellpath's own operations. The system handles intake screening, medical/mental health/dental charting, sick call management, chronic care tracking, CPOE, medication administration records (MAR), lab results, appointment scheduling, patient consent and grievance tracking, insurance/billing data, and integration with Jail Management Systems (JMS). Critically, ERMA has no patient portal — incarcerated patients do not have internet access. The certified module (ERMA Version 6) IS the product; there is no broader product beyond ERMA itself. However, the certification is very narrow (only 16 criteria), covering CPOE, drug checks, family history, EHI export, and security/audit — with no FHIR API, no patient access API, no C-CDA, no clinical quality measures, and no public health reporting.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "ERMA's EHI export uses HL7 v2.5 ADT (Admit-Discharge-Transfer) message format — an unusual choice for EHI export. HL7 v2 ADT messages are traditionally used for real-time encounter notification interfaces between systems, not for bulk data export. The format defines 13 segments: MSH (message header), PID (patient identification), PD1 (patient demographics), MRG (merge patient info), NK1 (next of kin), PV1 (patient visit), PV2 (additional visit info), AL1 (allergies), DG1 (diagnosis), PR1 (procedures), GT1 (guarantor), IN1 (insurance), IN2 (insurance additional), and ACC (accident). The specification reads like an HL7 interface specification repurposed as export documentation — complete with sending/receiving application fields, ACK types, and ADT trigger events. This approach inherently limits export completeness because HL7 v2 ADT messages are encounter-centric and cannot naturally represent longitudinal data like medication lists, lab result histories, clinical notes, or care plans as standalone entities. Key data the system stores (medications, labs, vitals, notes, assessments) has no corresponding segment in the export format.",

        "description": "The documentation is a 23-page PDF that specifies the HL7 v2.5 ADT message format for 13 segments.

Field-level detail is provided with sub-component breakdowns (e.g., PID.05.1 Last Name, PID.05.2 First Name). The document references HL7 2.5 codesets for enumerated fields (e.g., CS_GENDER, CS_RACE, CS_MARITAL_STATUS) but does not define those codesets within the document. No example messages, no sample data, no relationship diagrams. The format is clear and well-organized for what it covers, but it covers a narrow slice of the data ERMA actually stores.",

However, it has major gaps in clinical data despite ERMA's known capabilities. The system stores medications (CPOE-certified), lab results, clinical notes, intake assessments, mental health evaluations, chronic care tracking, vital signs, and appointment schedules — none of which appear in the export. The HL7 v2 ADT format is structurally unable to carry much of this data without additional segments (OBX, OBR, RXA, NTE, TXA, SCH). The export appears to be an HL7 interface specification repurposed as EHI export documentation, covering only the ADT feed content rather than all EHI stored by the system. For a correctional healthcare EHR, the absence of medication data is particularly concerning given the high-acuity patient population.",

However, critical clinical data is MISSING: no medications/prescriptions (despite CPOE certification), no lab results, no vitals, no clinical notes, no care plans, no immunizations, no family health history (despite (a)(12) certification), no intake assessments, no mental health evaluations, no chronic care data."

IN2 adds: Medicare card number, Medicaid case name/number, CHAMPUS/TRICARE details (sponsor, ID, organization, station, service, rank, status), payor ID/sub-ID, eligibility source, room coverage type/amount, policy type/amount, daily deductible, copay/stop-loss limits.

          "evidence": "No document or image segments in the export. No mechanism for scanned documents, uploaded files, consent form content, or binary data. PR1 has a consent code field but not the actual document.

      "issues": [
        "HL7 v2 ADT format is fundamentally inappropriate for comprehensive EHI export — it is an encounter notification standard, not a data export standard. The format structurally cannot represent medications, lab results, clinical notes, vital signs, or care plans without additional segment types not included in this specification.",
        "No medication data despite CPOE certification under 170.315(a)(1). ERMA stores medication orders and medication administration records (MAR), yet the export has no RXA, RXO, RXE, or ORC segments. For a correctional health population with high rates of mental health medications, chronic disease medications, and substance abuse treatment, this is a critical gap.",
        "No lab results despite the system storing lab data. No OBX/OBR segments for observations/results.",
        "No clinical notes or narrative documentation. Correctional healthcare generates extensive documentation: intake screenings, sick call notes, mental health assessments, chronic care visit notes, dental records. None appears in the export.",
        "No family health history despite certification under 170.315(a)(12), which specifically requires storing and managing family health history.",
        "No vital signs data.",
        "No appointment/scheduling data despite confirmed scheduling capability.",
        "The export specification appears to be a repurposed HL7 interface specification rather than a purpose-built EHI export. The presence of MSH sending/receiving application fields, ACK types, and ADT trigger events suggests this is documentation for an ADT feed to downstream systems, not a comprehensive data export.",
        "Many fields marked 'P' (Post-validator) — meaning they are not required and may be empty in practice, potentially reducing actual data content below what the specification suggests.",
        "Only 13 segments covering demographics, encounters, allergies, diagnoses, procedures, insurance, guarantor, and accidents. The system stores far more data than this."

  "summary": "Wellpath's ERMA is a proprietary correctional healthcare EHR used internally at 315+ facilities. The EHI export documentation describes an HL7 v2.5 ADT message format with 13 segments covering demographics, encounters, diagnoses, procedures, allergies, insurance, guarantor data, and accidents. While insurance coverage documentation is notably thorough (125+ fields across IN1/IN2), the export has critical gaps: no medications (despite CPOE certification), no lab results, no clinical notes, no vitals, no scheduling, and no documents. The format appears to be a repurposed HL7 interface specification rather than a comprehensive EHI export, covering only a fraction of the data ERMA stores for its correctional patient population.",

  "notes": "Wellpath's unique position as a correctional healthcare provider means some typical EHI categories (secure messaging, patient portal) are genuinely not applicable — inmates don't have internet access. However, the clinical data gaps (medications, labs, notes) are real and significant, particularly given the high-acuity correctional population. The HL7 v2 ADT approach is almost certainly insufficient to meet the b(10) requirement of exporting 'all electronic health information that can be stored by the product.' Wellpath filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2024 and emerged in May 2025, which may affect ongoing development and compliance efforts."
