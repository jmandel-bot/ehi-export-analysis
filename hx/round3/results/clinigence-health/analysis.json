        "description": "Clinigence VIP is NOT an EHR. It is a cloud-based healthcare analytics and population health management platform that specializes in clinical quality measure (CQM) reporting, value-based care analytics, and population health insights. The platform aggregates data from external sources (EHR clinical data in CCDa/QRDA/HL7 formats, claims feeds) and maps it to an internal 'clinical ontology.' It calculates quality measures (~200 measures including MIPS eCQMs), provides analytics dashboards (cost/utilization analysis, risk stratification using Johns Hopkins ACG model), and acts as a CMS Qualified Registry for MIPS data submission. The certified criteria confirm its narrow scope: (b)(10) EHI export, (c)(1)-(c)(3) CQMs, (d) privacy/security, and (g)(4)-(g)(5) quality management. It has NO clinical data creation criteria (a)(1)-(a)(14), NO patient portal (e)(1), and NO FHIR APIs (g)(7)-(g)(10). The platform serves health plans, ACOs, DCEs, provider groups, and TPAs. It was acquired by AssureCare in 2024 and was originally a subsidiary of Nutex Health. Because it only stores aggregated/derived data from other systems, its EHI is fundamentally secondary data — not the authoritative clinical record.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The export uses Clinigence's proprietary 'Version 5' XML format, one patient per file. This is a custom hierarchical schema (not FHIR, not C-CDA, not a database dump) designed for Clinigence's data exchange. The format has Actors (providers/organizations) at the top, followed by Patient records containing: demographic Properties, quality measure Program/Guideline/Measure assignments with MeasureClass dispositions and Evidence references, and clinical Objects classified by 32 defined object classes (Encounter, Lab, Medication, Vital Signs, Diagnosis, etc.). Objects contain Properties and Facts with optional UniversalKey coded references (LOINC, CPT, RxNorm, ICD). The export explicitly covers only data 'received by Clinigence Health from the data source(s) and is mapped to the Clinigence Health clinical ontology' — meaning unmapped data is excluded. Single-patient export is self-service via the UI; bulk export requires contacting support@clinigence.com. The documentation (schema, notes, sample) dates from March 2018 and has not been updated.",

        "description": "The documentation consists of three files in a ZIP: a Word document explaining the Version 5 format, an XSD schema definition, and a sample XML file. The Word doc explains the hierarchical data model (Objects/Properties/Facts), date conventions, the concept of Actors and Patients, and lists all 32 valid object classes. The XSD provides formal type definitions including string length constraints, enumerations (gender, actor types, provider relationship types, yes/no), and the full element hierarchy. The sample file demonstrates a realistic patient record with demographics, encounters (CPT-coded), labs, medications (RxNorm), vital signs (LOINC), and quality measure assignments. However: there is no data dictionary mapping object classes to expected properties/facts, no value set documentation beyond the few enumerations in the XSD, no relationship documentation between objects, and the schema's flexible Property/Fact model means the actual data content is largely undefined — any property name is valid. The documentation is adequate for understanding the format structure but insufficient for predicting what data will actually appear in an export.",

        "overall_assessment": "Coverage is narrow but appropriate given the product's nature as an analytics overlay, not an EHR. The Version 5 format supports 32 clinical object classes covering a reasonable range of clinical data types (encounters, diagnoses, medications, labs, vitals, immunizations, procedures, allergies, social history, care plans, notes). However, the export only contains data that was ingested from external sources and successfully mapped to the Clinigence ontology — it is inherently a secondary/derived dataset. The critical gap is in claims/financial data: Clinigence ingests claims data for cost/utilization analytics, but the Version 5 export format appears designed primarily for clinical data exchange, not financial data. The Payer object class exists but the sample only shows a policy number, not billing line items or payment amounts. The absence of messaging, scheduling, documents, and audit data is NOT a gap because the product genuinely does not store these — it has no patient portal, no scheduling, no document management. The overall EHI coverage is limited by the fundamental nature of the product: it's a data aggregation and quality reporting tool, not a system of record for patient care.",

The 'Payer' object class exists but the sample file only shows a policy number in a UniversalKey, not billing line items. Clinigence ingests claims data for cost/utilization analytics internally, but the Version 5 export format does not appear to convey financial detail (dollar amounts, payment status, adjustments). This is a potential gap — the platform likely stores claims-derived financial data that does not appear in the export."

        "Proprietary XML format (Version 5) with no ecosystem of parsing tools — recipients need vendor-provided documentation to interpret the data.",

  "summary": "Clinigence Health's Value Improvement Platform (VIP) is a healthcare analytics and population health management platform — not an EHR — certified only for EHI export, clinical quality measures, and privacy/security. Its EHI export uses a proprietary 'Version 5' XML format to export aggregated clinical data (encounters, diagnoses, medications, labs, vitals, quality measure results) that was received from external EHR and claims systems and mapped to the Clinigence clinical ontology. The export documentation is minimal (one ZIP with schema, notes, and sample from March 2018) and has not been updated in nearly 8 years. The primary concerns are: bulk export requires contacting vendor support, claims-derived financial data may not be exported despite being stored, and the export explicitly excludes data not mapped to the internal ontology.",

  "notes": "This product occupies an unusual niche in the ONC certification landscape — it is a data aggregation and quality reporting tool, not a clinical system. Its EHI is entirely derived from other sources, making it a secondary dataset. The absence of billing, scheduling, messaging, and document data in the export is largely explained by the product's limited scope, though the claims data used for cost analytics represents a potential gap. The product was acquired by AssureCare in 2024, raising questions about ongoing maintenance of this documentation and export capability."
