FHIR® [Condition] Resource - Encounter Diagnosis

This page provides technical documentation specific to Flatiron’s deployment of the FHIR® [Condition Encounter Diagnosis] Resource. Flatiron’s development of this API includes and builds upon the required components outlined within the Health Level 7® (HL7) FHIR® standard. Within the Profiles Supported row in the table below, you can find a link to the relevant HL7® FHIR® standard profile(s). All Flatiron supported API resources are based on FHIR® version 4.0.1 as required by the (g)(10) Standardized API for Patient and Population Services certification criteria included in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act. This page will be updated periodically as Flatiron expands our FHIR® API integration options.
