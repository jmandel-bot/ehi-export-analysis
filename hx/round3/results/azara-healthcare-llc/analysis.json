        "description": "Azara DRVS (Data Reporting and Visualization System) is a population health analytics and reporting platform — it is NOT an EHR. DRVS sits on top of 40+ EHR systems, aggregating clinical data, claims data, practice management data, and ADT feeds into a normalized, unified view with a Master Patient Index. It serves primarily FQHCs, PCAs, HCCNs, and ACOs. The platform stores aggregated clinical data (diagnoses, medications, labs, immunizations, care gaps), claims/cost data, risk stratification scores, SDOH data, quality measures, and specialty module data (dental, maternal/OB, substance use, infectious disease). It does NOT have a patient portal, billing/RCM system, scheduling system, or document management. It has a 'FinOps' analytics module that monitors billing workflows but is not a transactional billing system. The certified module IS the entire product — there is no broader product that DRVS is a component of. Azara merged with SPH Analytics' population health division in 2020 and acquired i2i Population Health in February 2025.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The documentation describes two export formats: (1) C-CDA XML bulk export compliant with USCDI Version 1, and (2) FHIR R4 Bulk Data export. However, the FHIR section is almost certainly copy-pasted from iPatientCare's (AssureCare LLC's) certification documentation — it literally names 'iPatientCare' instead of 'Azara DRVS' and references a companion API documentation PDF that is not available. The effective export is C-CDA only. This creates a fundamental format mismatch: DRVS stores aggregated population health data (quality measures, risk scores, care gaps, claims analytics, SDOH, specialty module data) but C-CDA is a clinical summary standard that cannot represent most of this data. The export is almost certainly limited to the subset of aggregated clinical data that fits into C-CDA sections (diagnoses, medications, labs, allergies, immunizations, vitals, procedures).",

The FHIR section contains a copy-paste error naming 'iPatientCare' instead of 'Azara DRVS', and references a companion API documentation PDF that is not available. The document was created in November 2023 and has not been updated since. This is among the least informative EHI export documentation encountered.",

        "overall_assessment": "The EHI coverage is severely inadequate. DRVS stores a rich set of aggregated population health data — clinical data from 40+ EHR systems, claims/cost data, quality measures, risk scores, care gaps, SDOH, and specialty module data (dental, maternal/OB, substance use, infectious disease). But the only described export format is C-CDA, which is a clinical summary standard that can represent only a fraction of this data. The documentation provides zero specifics about what C-CDA sections are populated or what data elements are included. Key DRVS data categories — claims analytics, risk stratification, quality measures, care gap analyses, specialty module data, SDOH assessments, survey results — have no representation in C-CDA and no alternative export mechanism is described. The product does not store secure messages, does not have its own scheduling system, and does not manage documents/images, so those categories are not applicable rather than missing. However, the claims/financial data and aggregated analytics data that DRVS does store appear to be completely absent from the export.",

        "Copy-paste documentation error: The FHIR section names 'iPatientCare' (an unrelated AssureCare LLC EHR product) instead of 'Azara DRVS', indicating this documentation was copied from another vendor's certification materials without proper review.

        "Stale documentation: Created November 2023, no evidence of updates in over 2 years.",

  "summary": "Azara Healthcare's DRVS is a population health analytics platform — not an EHR — that aggregates data from 40+ EHR systems for FQHCs and safety-net providers. Its EHI export documentation is a single one-page PDF with no technical detail, describing C-CDA and FHIR exports. The FHIR section was copy-pasted from iPatientCare (AssureCare LLC) documentation with the product name left unedited, raising serious questions about documentation accuracy. The C-CDA export format fundamentally cannot represent most of what DRVS stores — quality measures, risk scores, care gaps, claims analytics, SDOH, and specialty module data have no C-CDA representation and no alternative export mechanism.",

  "notes": "The 'iPatientCare' copy-paste error is a notable finding. iPatientCare is an ambulatory EHR owned by AssureCare LLC — a completely separate company with no known corporate relationship to Azara Healthcare. This suggests either a shared compliance consultant prepared both documents, or Azara used iPatientCare's publicly available certification documentation as a template. Either way, the error was not caught in over two years. The CHPL listing shows Azara DRVS is also certified for 170.315(c)(3) (Clinical quality measures), 170.315(g)(4)/(g)(5) (Quality management system/Accessibility-centered design), and various security criteria — but NOT for 170.315(g)(10) (Standardized API), which makes the FHIR Bulk Data export claim in the documentation even more suspect."
