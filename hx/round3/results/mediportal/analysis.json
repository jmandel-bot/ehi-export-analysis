        "description": "M-Power is a cloud-based EHR platform by Mediportal offered in three configurations: M-Power EMR (standalone clinical EHR at $249/month per provider), M-Power MIE (data aggregation/interoperability platform), and M-Power Ecosystem (enterprise customizable solution). The EMR includes SOAP note documentation with custom templates, appointment scheduling with automated reminders, e-prescribing, telemedicine, remote patient monitoring (RPM), secure messaging, patient portal (with mobile apps on iOS and Android called 'Mediportal Care'), digital registration/intake forms, lab results integration, imaging reports access, and analytics. The interoperability layer supports FHIR, HL7, and API-based data exchange using their 'SyncAI' engine. The product targets diverse healthcare settings including solo practices, provider organizations, ACOs, hospitals, health systems, and diagnostic labs. Notably, the vendor's website does not mention billing, revenue cycle management, claims processing, or insurance management — the product appears focused on clinical functionality without integrated billing/RCM.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The EHI export is a document-based approach using C-CDA and PDF formats bundled in a ZIP file. The export contains: (1) C-CDA documents representing clinical data, (2) PDF files for rendered documents, and (3) 'other files attached to the patient's chart' (uploaded attachments). This is not a database-native export — it relies on the C-CDA clinical summary standard, which has inherent limitations for non-clinical data categories. C-CDA is designed for clinical care summaries and transitions of care, not comprehensive data warehouse exports. The use of PDF as a primary format for some data means portions of the export are not machine-readable. The ZIP-within-ZIP structure (the export ZIP contains ZIP files of PDFs, C-CDAs, and other files) is somewhat unusual.",

There is no data dictionary, no field-level documentation, no table or resource definitions, no schema documentation, no value set definitions, no relationship documentation, no sample data, and no version information. A patient or provider reading this documentation would learn only the file formats used, not what data categories are included, how data is organized, or what fields are available.",

        "overall_assessment": "The export relies on C-CDA and PDF formats, which provide reasonable clinical data coverage but are fundamentally limited for non-clinical EHI categories. C-CDA covers clinical summaries (diagnoses, medications, allergies, labs, vitals, procedures, immunizations) but lacks standard representations for secure messages, scheduling data, and detailed billing information. The product has features (scheduling, secure messaging, patient portal) whose data almost certainly cannot be captured by C-CDA. The absence of billing data is less concerning because the product does not appear to have billing/RCM capabilities. However, the documentation is so minimal that it's impossible to confirm exactly what data categories are included or excluded — the 5-sentence description only names file formats, not data content.",
        "clinical": {
          "present": true,
          "evidence": "C-CDA is the primary clinical export format, which covers diagnoses, medications, allergies, vitals, labs, immunizations, procedures, clinical notes, assessments, and care plans. The product has SOAP note documentation, e-prescribing, lab integration, and imaging — these clinical data types should map reasonably well to C-CDA sections. However, C-CDA is a summary format and may not capture the full granularity of all clinical data stored internally (e.g., all historical revisions, draft notes, RPM data streams)."
        },
        "secure_messages": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "The product has secure messaging between patients and providers (confirmed on EMR features page and via patient portal mobile apps on iOS/Android). However, C-CDA has no standard section for patient-provider portal messages, and the export documentation does not mention messages. This is a significant gap — the product stores messaging data that the export format cannot naturally represent."

        "billing_financial": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "The vendor's website does not mention billing, revenue cycle management, claims, charges, or insurance management anywhere in its product marketing. The product appears to be a clinical-only EHR without integrated billing/RCM. If the product genuinely does not store billing data, its absence from the export is not a compliance gap. However, the extremely minimal documentation makes it impossible to confirm whether any financial data (e.g., copay amounts collected, service codes) might be stored but not exported."
        },
        "insurance_coverage": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "No mention of insurance data in the export documentation. The product has digital registration/intake forms which might capture insurance information, but C-CDA's payer section is limited. No evidence the product has dedicated insurance management features."

        "appointments_scheduling": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "The product has appointment scheduling with automated reminders (confirmed on features page), but C-CDA does not have a standard section for appointment/scheduling data.

        "documents_images": {
          "present": true,
          "evidence": "The export explicitly includes PDFs and 'other files attached to the patient's chart,' indicating that scanned documents, uploaded images, and other attachments are included in the ZIP export. This is a positive inclusion. However, the PDF format for documents means the content is rendered/flattened rather than structured — clinical notes exported as PDF lose their structured data representation."

The C-CDA + PDF approach provides basic clinical data coverage but inherently cannot capture secure messages, scheduling data, or other non-clinical categories that the product stores.

  "notes": "The vendor's disclosures page lists 21 certified criteria while the CHPL metadata only shows 11. The additional criteria (b(1), c(1)-(c)(3), d(6), d(8), g(2), g(6), g(9), g(10)) may reflect additional certifications not yet reflected in the CHPL data or a discrepancy between the vendor's claims and CHPL records. The presence of g(9) and g(10) on the disclosures page indicates the product also has FHIR API capabilities, which could complement the file-based EHI export."
