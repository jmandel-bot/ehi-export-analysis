        "description": "PacEHR is a specialty EHR designed specifically for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care (PALTC) providers, particularly Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs). It is the core clinical product within Sai Systems Digital LLC's broader platform called 'TheSNFist Suite,' which also includes billEHR (mobile charge capture), Revenue Cycle Management, Medical Coding and Billing, Credentialing/Enrollment, SNFConnect (internal facility communications), TheSNFist Telehealth, and Chronic Care Management services. PacEHR features voice-to-text documentation, customized macros, encounter templates, real-time AI coding for ICD/CPT ('Point of Service Awareness'), built-in encounter/note signing, PointClickCare integration, and facility-based patient census management. The product relies on Updox as additional software for certification compliance, likely for patient portal/engagement capabilities. The certification footprint is relatively limited: (a)(1) CPOE medications, (a)(5) demographics, (a)(14) implantable devices, (b)(1) transitions of care, (b)(10)/(b)(11) EHI export, plus security, API, and direct messaging criteria. Notably absent from certification: CPOE for labs/imaging, problem list management, medication allergy list, clinical decision support, and patient portal.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "Two export approaches are described across two different pages, creating confusion. The registered URL (saisystems.com/health/pacehr-ehi/) describes export in 'machine readable XML formats' utilizing PacEHR's FHIR APIs. The thesnfist.com/pacehr-ehi/ page describes a 'PacEHR-native, computable, delimited file format' where each table is exported as an individual file — this sounds like a native database export. The native table export is the more promising approach for EHI completeness, but its data dictionary (a referenced zip file) is inaccessible due to a broken download link. The only documented export details are the FHIR API endpoints at thesnfist.com/cures-update/, which cover 15 FHIR resources aligned to USCDI v1/v2 data elements. The FHIR implementation appears to use STU3. Without the native table data dictionary, the actual scope and coverage of the EHI export cannot be fully assessed.",

The only technical documentation available is the FHIR API page at thesnfist.com/cures-update/, which lists 15 FHIR resources with their USCDI data elements, endpoint paths, query parameters, and examples.

      "ehi_coverage": {
        "overall_assessment": "Based on available documentation, PacEHR's EHI export coverage is clinically focused but missing major non-clinical categories. The FHIR API documents 15 resources covering standard clinical data (allergies, conditions, medications, observations, procedures, immunizations, goals, care plans, care teams, encounters, devices, documents, patients, practitioners, locations). However, billing/financial data, insurance/coverage, secure messaging, and audit trails are entirely absent from all documentation — despite the broader TheSNFist Suite having extensive billing, RCM, and charge capture capabilities. The native database table export referenced on thesnfist.com/pacehr-ehi/ could potentially cover more categories, but the data dictionary is inaccessible due to a broken download link. The assessment is therefore incomplete, but what IS documented covers only clinical data aligned to USCDI, which represents a fraction of the EHI that the product system likely stores.",

The product relies on Updox (third-party) for patient engagement and SNFConnect for internal facility communications, but neither appears in export documentation. The product is not certified for (e)(1) patient portal, so patient-facing messaging may not be a core feature, but internal facility communications via SNFConnect likely generate stored data that is not addressed."

          "present": false,
          "evidence": "No billing, charge, claim, payment, transaction, CPT, revenue, or financial resources documented anywhere in the EHI export. This is a significant gap: PacEHR has integrated real-time AI coding for ICD/CPT codes ('Point of Service Awareness'), the billEHR mobile charge capture module, and the broader TheSNFist Suite includes full Revenue Cycle Management and Medical Coding/Billing services. Financial data almost certainly exists in the system but is not reflected in the export documentation."

          "present": false,
          "evidence": "No insurance, coverage, eligibility, authorization, payer, or benefits resources documented. The TheSNFist Suite includes Credentialing and Enrollment services and Payor Enrollment, suggesting insurance/payer data is managed in the system."

        "appointments_scheduling": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "No appointment or scheduling resources documented. Encounter resources cover visit data (type, time, location, disposition) but do not represent future appointments or scheduling. In the SNF/PALTC context, scheduling is rounding-based rather than appointment-based, so this may be less of a gap than in ambulatory settings."

          "present": true,
          "evidence": "DocumentReference FHIR resource covers CCDA clinical documents (consultation notes, discharge summaries, H&P, procedure notes, progress notes, imaging narrative, lab reports, pathology reports). The thesnfist.com EHI page notes: 'certain electronic health information, such as rich text documents or images, may not be available in table format. However, these are referenced in the extracts created for subsequent export.' This suggests documents/images exist in the system and are at least referenced in the export, though they may not be directly included in the delimited table files."

        "Inconsistent export descriptions: The registered URL describes 'machine readable XML formats' using FHIR APIs, while thesnfist.com describes 'PacEHR-native, computable, delimited file format' with individual table files. These appear to be different mechanisms but the relationship is unclear.",
        "No billing data in export despite product having extensive billing capabilities: PacEHR has real-time CPT/ICD coding, integrates with billEHR charge capture, and the TheSNFist Suite includes full RCM services. None of this financial data appears in any export documentation.",
        "Anti-bot protection blocks curl access: Both saisystems.com and thesnfist.com return HTTP 403 to curl, requiring browser access to view documentation. This reduces accessibility for automated compliance auditing.",

  "summary": "Sai Systems Digital LLC's PacEHR is a specialty PALTC/SNF EHR whose EHI export documentation is split across two websites with inconsistent descriptions. The registered URL (saisystems.com) describes XML/FHIR-based export while thesnfist.com describes a native database table export. The most critical documentation artifact — a data dictionary zip file — is referenced but inaccessible due to a broken download link (the 'CLICK HERE' text is not a hyperlink). The only accessible technical documentation is a FHIR API page covering 15 clinical resources aligned to USCDI, which entirely omits billing, insurance, messaging, scheduling, and audit data despite the broader TheSNFist Suite having extensive billing and RCM capabilities.",

  "notes": "The vendor maintains two separate websites (saisystems.com/health/ and thesnfist.com/) with overlapping but inconsistent EHI export information. Both sites block curl with 403 responses, requiring browser access. The thesnfist.com/pacehr-ehi/ page appears to be the more authoritative EHI documentation but is not the registered URL on CHPL. The broken data dictionary link is the single most impactful finding — if it were working, the native table export documentation might reveal a much more complete EHI export than the FHIR API alone suggests."
