Discover The entry point to Netsmart’s software development process is referred to as the “Discover” phase. At an organizational level, opportunities that require new development are identified, decided on, and prioritized. There are multiple avenues for ideas and issues to be identified. Such avenues entail: Client Portal, Support Requests for Enhancements or Faults, Internal and External Collaboration, Regulatory or Custom Controls at the Facility, Local, State, Federal, or Affiliated Agency Levels. Internal and external opportunities are reviewed when presented and analyzed to determine market need, revenue potential, technical debt, and scalability across the platforms. Annually, the opportunities resulting from final selection will comprise the upcoming annual solution roadmap. If required, a business case is prepared and presented to the identified stakeholders in order to gain approval, needed funding, and clear entrance and exit criteria. This allows Netsmart the ability to align the strategic direction with the expected results and initiatives as defined in the roadmap. Once approved, a Project Lead is identified to collaborate with necessary parties to identify, gather, and present the following:  Vision and Success Criteria  Initial Business Requirements or User Stories  Project Team Assignment and Procurement  Known Infrastructure, environment, or facility needs.  Engineering Milestones, Tools, and Release Schedule  Risk Assessment  Control, Monitoring, Traceability Metrics and tools  Documentation and Tracking Repository, tools, and change management  Communication strategy (who, what, when, how)  Client Partnership & Engagement Plans Alignment to the Quality Management System will entail a kick-off meeting or discussion and assignment where all members are aware of their level of involvement and commitment, roles within the sprints/iterations, schedule & release plan, and overall vision and purpose for the project. This phase closely models ISO 9901:2015(E) Section 4 (Context of the Organization), Section 6 (Planning), Section 7 (Support). Further scheduled monitoring and control sessions include presenting the state of progression in accordance with the defined roadmap.","applicableCriteria":"All"},{"id":4532,"qmsStandardId":19,"qmsStandardName":"Modified QMS/Mapped","qmsModification":"2. Design This includes all aspects of software design which are performed iteratively following the Discover phase. At the forefront of each iteration, requirements are reviewed by the Product and Engineering team. Requirements can come in many forms and completeness. At the minimum the business will have identified the User Stories or High Level Business Requirements that are required for the work product during the initiation phase, and stored centrally. These will comprise the baseline set to start the conversation. Once this is achieved one of two things can occur: 1. A Business Analyst can further expand the requirements into a more detailed specification, along with identified functional requirements. This work is to be done one iteration out to ensure the team members can perform their assigned tasks. OR 2. The Test Cases can become the requirements being identified at the start of and throughout the iteration as collaboration occurs and the product evolves. If requirements are initially captured keeping testing in mind, they begin to build themselves and quickly evolve into tests themselves with minimal alteration. A review of the available baseline requirements occurs normally at the first part of an iteration to gather any additional information required to proceed for the committed stories in the iteration. In the event the user story is not complete or additional stories are required, the team generates them at the beginning of the iteration. This may include engaging stakeholders and clients as necessary. If the story or stories are identified as needing to shift back into the backlog, they can be removed from the iteration and assigned to the backlog during the first part of the iteration. If the project involves a user interface, user experience wireframes and/or presentation layers with graphics are also developed in the initial stages as part of the requirements, and iteratively expanded as needed. These create a visual and in some cases interactive preview of the solution prior to development. Requirements and design artifacts are continually evaluated to be in alignment with the solution and in accordance with expectations as outlined in ISO 9901:2015(E) Section 8.2 (Requirements for products and services) and 8.3 (Design of products and services) to ensure adherence to the overall organization and product strategy and alignment with client and stakeholder needs. The design effort for each project will vary based on the nature and complexity of the development activity required. The inputs required for development to commence will be generated.","applicableCriteria":"All"},{"id":4533,"qmsStandardId":19,"qmsStandardName":"Modified QMS/Mapped","qmsModification":"3. Develop The “Develop” phase refers to the iterative development and release of the solution, and as such involves further expansion of the items noted in the “Design” phase as well as code construction. This primarily models ISO 9901:2015(E) Section 8.3 (Development of products and services), Section 8.4 (Control of externally provided processes, products and services), and Section 8.7 (Control of nonconforming outputs). Each User Story and/or Scenario should be finite encapsulating a small work deliverable, each with their Level of Effort captured. This allows for the ability to transform into a set of unit tests that can be further validated upon each build and/or execution. Each test is not to become a constraint on change but rather enable it. The tests are not to be too tightly coupled with the implementation of the code that is being tested. Such tests are about the interactions between the objects as much as within the object itself. The development team proceeds with code construction with possible testing occurring in parallel to development efforts. Generally the timeframe for the first development “sprint” will not exceed 3 weeks, with 2 weeks being the average. The result of the initial sprint is referred to as “Iteration 0” and becomes the starting place for all future iterative development sprints. The primary goal is to complete enough of a set of software work items to constitute a demonstrable and encapsulated version that can be built and further released. Continuous collaboration with all team members is facilitated so that we can successfully deliver on commitments and have the agility and ability to adapt quickly to change and re-factor where needed. The same standards apply for design rules/patterns, code check-in/check-out procedures, code review, coding & build standards, and traceability to requirements. As development is occurring, critical faults found prior to release should be resolved within that iteration. Lower severity faults can be placed into backlog for inclusion into other iterations. In addition to development, other activities to be considered are:  Iteration Demo: If at the end of an iteration, a release is not planned, it can be beneficial to create a short demo of the work that has been completed. It can be distributed internally to keep all interested parties aware of the progress and promote further feedback from varying parties.  Technical Code Review: All the source code that is generated during the iteration is to be qualified for completeness, standards compliance, and ability for the design and solution to meet the business needs in the short and long term. If this does not occur at the closure of an iteration it must occur prior to the release.","applicableCriteria":"All"},{"id":4535,"qmsStandardId":19,"qmsStandardName":"Modified QMS/Mapped","qmsModification":"4. Deliver Delivery includes the continual distribution, communication, and implementations of the solution. Upon deployment, ongoing support, control analysis, defect management, continued product improvements, and release documentation will occur in alignment with ISO 9901:2015(E) Section 8.5 (Production and service provision), section 9 (Performance evaluation), and section 10 (Improvement). This may involve the inclusion of a maintenance team, additional parties, and hosting and security team. As such, a plan and transition will occur to ensure proper handover upon production release. For project releases, the warranty phase will continue to fall under scope of the Project Lead to manage and publish status. First of a Kind (FOAK) development effort will undergo Early Adopter testing with a previously identified and contracted client. This will constitute “real world” testing with the Netsmart and client teams often working side by side to identify any issues or recommended improvements. These items are evaluated and incorporated as appropriate prior to a general release to all clients. The periodic review of solution roadmaps, support management, and infrastructure processes will apply to the future maintenance of the work product and each release that occurs thereafter. As updates are applied, the need to maintain supporting documentation and transition practices remain. The cycle through the process is similar to that of a larger project, just smaller in scale. Key components to ongoing quality management for solutions include: Regression Root Cause Analysis process, continued regression test automation, infrastructure monitoring, support trending and monitoring, client health score cards, highlighted client focus, and periodic review of the QMS and facets within.  The Root Cause Analysis process enforces the proper review, expanded automation, and a continued improvement upstream so as to not reintroduce non-conformity into the solution. As well, other possible faults that could have been introduced are prevented once preventive action is in place as defining is to be broader in scope.  Specific client focus includes keying in on edge case clients to sharpen the focus on specific faults and identified patterns. Regression Root Cause Analysis may occur as well as further analysis, solution review and improvement.  Support and Social board discussion highlights and pattern recognition are continuously reviewed. Recurring reviews are required with Engineering and Support to ensure proper review and analysis more proactively.  4D Project Roadmap ensures the right projects are selected and tracked in accordance with the overall organization strategic direction and vision.","applicableCriteria":"All"},{"id":4530,"qmsStandardId":19,"qmsStandardName":"Modified QMS/Mapped","qmsModification":"Description of Netsmart’s Quality Management System Netsmart’s approach to quality begins with our software development methodology. Netsmart has adopted an agile methodology for software development which focuses on the 4 primary components to software solutions and their evolution: Discover, Design, Develop, and Deliver. Netsmart’s Quality Management System models facets of the ISO 9001:2015(E) Quality Management Principles and Requirements: • Customer focus • Leadership • Engagement of People • Process Approach • Improvement • Evidence-based decision making • Relationship Management Each component embodies the principles and requirements within itself and across the systems. The systematic definition, management, and adherence to defined processes enables Netsmart to effectively work towards realizing overall Client and Organization strategic objectives. Leadership is committed to upholding each phase of the QMS via several targeted control metrics and monitoring structured for each phase as modeled in ISO 9001:2015(E) Section 5 (Leadership) and Section 7 (Support). Achievement of such is seen through some of the measures at varying levels below: • Broad level: KPI Dashboards, Quarterly Operations Book and Quality Trending, Sync Sessions, Town hall, Regulatory requirements, Infrastructure Alerts & Monitoring • Project Level: 4D Review Sessions, Resource Alignment & Procurement, Artifact repository, Entrance & Exit criteria, Market acceptance, project profitability. • Client Level: Client Health Scorecards, Innovations voting • Personnel: Recruiting, aligned qualifications and competency, direct accountability, clear roles and responsibilities, annual review process, Training","applicableCriteria":"All"},{"id":4534,"qmsStandardId":19,"qmsStandardName":"Modified QMS/Mapped","qmsModification":"Develop Continued… Testing At Netsmart, quality is the responsibility of the team as a whole. All active members become functional experts and can perform the test role in creating test cases based on the need during that iteration. This evolution continues to retain some concepts and types of testing. Newer types include exploratory testing where the story is not fully complete or even fully defined. It could be required to vet out an idea and feasibility. The most prominent is Business Acceptance Testing and Functional Testing though it now occurs while development is still occurring as well as when completed. Further risk mitigation occurs with regression test automation. At the start of each iteration, with the other team members, the test plan and required test cases are established. The test cases may become the definitive set of requirements as clarity is established and the abstract and nebulous statements are further elaborated upon. Effectively, these are created Just-In-Time and comprising the detailed specifications. The collaboration and the integration of cross-functional roles allows the testers to gain a greater technical understanding of the design and architecture enabling more meaningful discussions for the project and projects downstream. All methods of tests can be performed within an iteration. Some can be done independently for those that are specialized or performed by another party that is not a member of the team. Each test further validates the development outputs meet the requirements as identified. This includes all functional and non-functional validation for the solution and external 3rd party integration and contractual requirements and processes. The inconsistencies or gaps identified in the test results are continually reviewed with corresponding development cycles occurring for resolution. Final results for conformity are produced to properly evaluate release readiness and alignment to exit or success criteria. Release with non-conforming results will have been agreed upon by stakeholders and communicated to clients which may include inclusion of known issues in a release note. Release Each release is designed to deliver a “shippable” work product with all the necessary supporting marketing material, packaging, support transitions, client communication strategy, and documentation. Delivery can include publishing to a client system, hosting internally, or a packaged product. For work that is within the scope of a project, the tasks are to be managed by the identified Project Lead to ensure tracking and completion.
