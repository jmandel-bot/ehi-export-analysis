This begins in the Concept phase where product management experts, physicians and executive management define, review and approve new product ideas. Our Product Development Lifecycle Process defines how features are defined and controlled and management review and approval to proceed is obtained. Further refinement of the specification occurs next in Requirement Management activity. Multi-functional engineering, program management, QA/test, physicians, user experience and user documentation teams review the requirements produced by the business analysts. These quality management peer reviews use quality checklists and knowledge of the approved feature baseline in order to determine that the intended functionality is being properly defined and will be reflected in the end product. Similar techniques are used during subsequent design and construct phases. Finally the Verification & Validation activity is driven by the requirements' baseline and traces the evolution of features - to- requirements - to - design and then into specific test cases. This independent verification step ensures product readiness for the Beta and eventual General release of the product. 1.             Defined processes, procedures and other job aids are available throughout this lifecycle, including Requirements Management, Requirements Review & Approval, Software Architecture & Design, Program & Project Management, QA/Test, User-Centered Design and final User Documentation. 2.             The program/project managers monitor various aspects of the design/construct activity and testing run by the QA teams to monitor progress, quality & scope on the evolving products. The project team status reports, QA progress, and peer review results are gathered and used to determine how well the product production is progressing and to assess whether intervention is required. 3.             Compliance reports and requirement completion statuses are used to monitor process compliance. 4.             Processes & process support materials are defined and controlled within NextGen's QMS only after multi-functional review & approval. 5.             Product and project artifact and specification templates, examples and quality standards are defined and maintained with NextGen's QMS. b.             NextGen's Change Control Process establishes the approach for controlling changes to the product baseline features, requirements and timeline and is used throughout the production lifecycle. c.              Environmental issues are mostly not applicable to our software lifecycle; however architectural designs and constraints are produced to support verification of the system requirements for the end product. d.

Software upgrade are installed & checked out using a pre-defined quality checklist in a test environment prior to release approval and issuance into full production. The QA/test team uses the same lifecycle management system mentioned previously. In addition to that the QA/Test team utilizes a software tool, integrated with the lifecycle management system, to automate the functional testing of NextGen products. This tool is also maintained in a similar manner as the lifecycle management system; upgrades are planned and test in an off-line manner so as to not interfere or risk the on-going production activity. Detailed test checklists are used to ensure proper functionality prior to release approval and issuance. § 820.72 Inspection, measuring, and test equipment 820.72 is Not Applicable to NextGen, all NextGen products, the product features and requirements are verified by testing or inspection.
