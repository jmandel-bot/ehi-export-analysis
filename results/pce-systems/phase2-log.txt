## Overview

PCE Systems is a small, privately held IT services company based in Farmington Hills, Michigan, with an estimated 11–50 employees. The company specializes in building custom, fully-hosted electronic health record (EHR) and care management software for community-based behavioral health and social service organizations. PCE's primary market is Michigan's public behavioral health system — specifically the Community Mental Health Service Programs (CMHSPs) and Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (PIHPs) that serve Medicaid beneficiaries with mental illness, substance use disorders, and developmental disabilities.

As of a 2013 press release, PCE described itself as "the largest behavioral health Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and provider management system vendor in the State of Michigan, with clients encompassing over 70% of the Michigan Medicaid mental health budget." The company has been in operation since at least 2001 (per Wayback Machine records). Jeff Chang, identified as Project Manager in 2013, is now CEO. The company's website is deliberately minimal — just a logo and navigation links (Home, About, Location), with the About and Location pages returning 404 errors as of 2025. The site has looked essentially the same since at least 2019. PCE does not appear to have a public marketing presence, product demos, or feature pages. This is consistent with a vendor whose customers are a known, finite set of government-funded behavioral health agencies in Michigan, acquired through direct relationships rather than inbound marketing.

## Product: PCE Care Management

CHPL ID: 11045
CHPL Product Number: 15.04.04.2125.PCEC.94.01.1.221205
Version: 9.4

### What It Is

PCE Care Management is a behavioral health EHR system designed to manage the full lifecycle of care for individuals receiving community mental health, substance use disorder treatment, and developmental disability services. The SED (Safety-Enhanced Design) intended user description in CHPL metadata is simply "Behavioral Health."

The product is broadly certified across 44 ONC criteria spanning clinical data (a)(1)–(a)(5), (a)(12), (a)(14)–(a)(15); transitions of care (b)(1)–(b)(3), (b)(9)–(b)(11); patient portal (e)(1), (e)(3); clinical quality measures (c)(1)–(c)(4); public health reporting (f)(1), (f)(7); and FHIR APIs (g)(7), (g)(9)–(g)(10). This is a comprehensive certification profile indicating a full-featured clinical EHR, not a limited-scope module.

The certified product appears to be the entire system — there is no evidence of PCE Care Management being a module within a larger product platform. The system is described as "fully-hosted" (cloud/hosted model, not on-premise), and the production FHIR API endpoint is at `w3.pcesecure.com`.

### Users & Market

**Primary users:** Clinicians, case managers, and administrative staff at Michigan community-based behavioral health organizations — including CMHSPs (Community Mental Health Service Programs), PIHPs (Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans), and their contracted service providers.

**Known customers:**
- **Detroit Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN)** — the largest PIHP in Michigan, serving Wayne County (Detroit metro area). DWIHN's website hosts PCE API documentation and MichiCANS assessment training materials for PCE Systems.
- **Oakland Community Health Network (OCHN)** — a CMH authority serving ~30,000 Oakland County citizens at 400+ service sites. OCHN's website explicitly names PCE Systems as their EHR vendor and references the PCE API and patient portal (CEHR).
- **Community Mental Health Partnership of Southeast Michigan (CMHPSM)** — a PIHP serving Lenawee, Livingston, Monroe, and Washtenaw counties. CMHPSM's website describes their PCE-based EHR as "CRCT" (Confidential Record of Consumer Treatment), used by the PIHP, partner CMHSPs, and providers for claims submission, incident reporting, and service information.
- **Washtenaw County Community Mental Health** — featured in an ONC Brightspot case study as a PCE customer. Serves 5,000+ children and adults with serious mental illness, developmental disabilities, or emotional disturbances.

**Clinical settings:** These are not private medical practices. PCE's customers are publicly funded behavioral health authorities that manage networks of providers serving vulnerable populations — people with serious mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression), substance use disorders, developmental disabilities (autism, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment), and co-occurring conditions. Settings include community mental health centers, substance abuse treatment programs, crisis services, residential treatment, clubhouse programs, and social service organizations.

**Geographic concentration:** Heavily Michigan-focused. All identified customers are Michigan public behavioral health entities. The 2013 claim of 70%+ of Michigan's Medicaid mental health budget suggests PCE is the dominant vendor across the state's CMH system.

**Scale:** PCE is small (11–50 employees) but punches above its weight in terms of the population served — Michigan's public behavioral health system serves hundreds of thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries across dozens of CMHSPs.

### Modules & Functionality

PCE's website provides essentially zero product information. However, the following functionality is documented across multiple third-party sources:

**Clinical Documentation & Care Management:**
- Intake and assessment (per MedicalRecords.com profile)
- Individualized treatment plan creation and tracking (MedicalRecords.com)
- Clinical assessments including MichiCANS (Michigan Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths) — confirmed by DWIHN training materials
- Integrated health management / care coordination across providers (MedicalRecords.com)
- Discharge planning (MedicalRecords.com)
- Incident reporting (CMHPSM EHR page)

**Patient Portal (CEHR):**
- The patient portal is referenced as "CEHR" in the API documentation and the OCHN website
- Supports SMART on FHIR OAuth2 patient authentication
- Certified for patient view/download/transmit — (e)(1)

**Health Information Exchange (PIX):**
- PCE operates "PIX" (Provider Information Exchange), a behavioral health HIE built into the platform
- PIX uses common HIE standards and APIs to connect PCE EHR implementations across Michigan
- PIX enables providers to search for patient records from other PCE implementations, finding care team info, treatment plans, appointments, problem lists, medications, vitals, lab results, and clinical documentation (per ONC Brightspot case study)
- PIX is consent-managed — PCE built an eConsent Management System for 42 CFR Part 2 compliance (substance use disorder treatment privacy) and Michigan Mental Health Code requirements
- PCE is connected to MiHIN (Michigan Health Information Network) as a Virtually Qualified Data Sharing Organization, enabling data exchange between behavioral health and physical health networks

**MI Care Connect Portal:**
- A standalone portal providing PIX access to community partners who may not use PCE's EHR directly
- Used by community organizations like Packard Health, Shelter Association of Washtenaw County, and Avalon Housing (per ONC Brightspot)

**Billing:**
- Billing is described as integrated in the MedicalRecords.com profile ("from... all the way to billing")
- CMHPSM describes using the PCE EHR for "claims submission"
- TMG (The TM Group) sells a separate integration product ($5,000) connecting PCE Systems to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central for accounting — handling cost centers, accounts payable transactions, and vendor information. This suggests PCE handles clinical billing/claims internally but some organizations use external accounting systems for financial management.
- The FHIR API includes Claims and Coverage resources, confirming claims data is stored

**Public Health Reporting:**
- Certified for (f)(1) transmission to immunization registries and (f)(7) health care surveys

**Clinical Quality Measures:**
- Certified for CQM recording (c)(1), import (c)(2), export (c)(3), and filtering (c)(4)

**FHIR API (g)(10)):**
- Full SMART on FHIR API supporting Patient and Population Services
- Exposed FHIR resources per API documentation: AllergyIntolerance, CarePlan, CareTeam, Claim, Condition, Coverage, Device, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, Encounter, Goal, HealthcareService, Immunization, Location, MedicationRequest, Observation, Organization, Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Procedure, Provenance
- Also includes a Message data element in API documentation, suggesting messaging capabilities
- Supports bulk export for population-level data access

### Data & Content

Based on the evidence gathered, PCE Care Management stores the following categories of data:

**Clinical Data** (confirmed via FHIR API resources and USCDI mapping in API documentation):
- Patient demographics
- Allergies and intolerances
- Conditions / problem lists
- Medications (medication requests)
- Immunizations
- Procedures
- Vital signs, laboratory results, smoking status (via Observations)
- Diagnostic reports
- Clinical notes / documents (DocumentReference, DiagnosticReport)
- Care plans / assessment and plan of treatment
- Care team members
- Goals
- Implantable devices (UDI)
- Encounters
- Provenance

**Behavioral Health-Specific Data** (confirmed via various sources):
- Treatment plans (individualized, per MedicalRecords.com and ONC Brightspot)
- Clinical assessments (MichiCANS and likely others — per DWIHN training materials)
- Intake and assessment records
- Discharge records
- Incident reports (per CMHPSM)
- Consent directives (eConsent Management System for 42 CFR Part 2 and Michigan Mental Health Code)

**Claims & Financial Data:**
- Claims data (FHIR Claims resource in API; CMHPSM uses system for "claims submission")
- Coverage / insurance information (FHIR Coverage resource)
- Service information reporting (per CMHPSM)

**Administrative & Care Coordination Data:**
- Provider/practitioner information (Practitioner, PractitionerRole resources)
- Organization and location data
- Healthcare service definitions
- Care team assignments
- Messages (Message data element in API documentation)
- Patient portal (CEHR) data — access logs, patient interactions

**Documents & Files:**
- Scanned documents, PDFs, and other non-computable files (confirmed by EHI export documentation which describes a "Files subdirectory" containing "exported, non-computable files... e.g., scanned documents, PDFs")

**Notable Data Considerations:**
- 42 CFR Part 2 data: The system explicitly manages substance use disorder treatment records with consent-based access controls. The API Terms of Use specifically references compliance with "42 C.F.R. Part 2" alongside HIPAA.
- Social service referral data: PCE signed MiHIN's Interoperable Referrals Pledge (2022) alongside social care companies like findhelp, Unite Us, and WellSky, suggesting the platform handles social service referral data.
- The EHI export documentation (b)(10) is only 3 pages and describes the export format (password-protected zip, NDJSON per resource, documentation.json for schema) but does **not** enumerate the specific data resources included in the export. The resource definitions are embedded in the `documentation.json` file within the export itself.

**Information gaps:**
- No product feature page, user manual, or detailed module documentation is publicly available from PCE Systems
- The vendor website is essentially non-functional for research purposes
- Scheduling capabilities are not mentioned in any source, though they likely exist given the ONC Brightspot mentions "appointments" as viewable through PIX
- e-Prescribing (EPCS, Surescripts integration) is not mentioned — behavioral health prescribing patterns may differ from general ambulatory care
- Patient messaging details beyond the API's Message data element are unclear
- Whether the system handles authorization/prior-auth workflows for Medicaid services is unclear, though this would be expected for a CMH/PIHP-focused product

Good context. PCE is a Michigan behavioral health EHR vendor. The product research already mentions that EHI export docs are only 3 pages and describe a password-protected zip with NDJSON + `documentation.json`. Let me now probe the registered URL.

Introduction
The data export process allows authorized EHR users to export patient-related electronic health information out of the
EHR system. Data may be exported per patient or for all patients within the EHR.

Export Format
The export process produces one or more password-protected zip files each containing information about the export
process, data for one or more patients, and the structure and syntax of the data. The password is provided with the zip
file(s).
Each zip file also contains the following files / directories:
1. meta.json – This file contains information about the export process that produced the data, including who ran it
and when.
2. documentation.json – This file contains EHR system information and a list of data definitions, descriptions, and
types for exported resources, as described in the “Resource / Data Definitions” section below.
3. Patient_[EHRPatientId] – One or more subdirectories are included where patient-specific data is found as
described in the “Patient Subdirectories” section below.

Resource / Data Definitions
The documentation.json file contained within the zip file includes a JSON-structured index of all possible resource
definitions. This is available under the attribute “resourceDefinitions”. Resource Definitions consists of a list of resources
each having two properties:
1. Name: This property distinguishes the resource and is used to reference the resource from within the exported
patient data
2. propertyDefinitions: This is a list of the properties comprising a resource.
Property Definitions are represented by the following attributes:
1. name: This property distinguishes the property
2. type: This represents the data type of values stored within the property, which comes from the following values:
a. CLOB – Character Large Object Value
b. DATE – A date represented in YYYY-MM-DD format
c. DECIMAL – Numeric value with a precision and scale
d. INTEGER – Numeric, whole-number value
e. RESOURCE – A reference to another resource within the export. This contains the following additional
attributes:
i. resource – identifies the name attribute of the referenced resource
ii. id – matches the value of the id attribute of the referenced resource
f. STRING – Alphanumeric / variable character field
g. TIMESTAMP – A date and time represented in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format

Patient Subdirectories
The zip file will contained one subdirectory for each patient whose data was exported through this process. The
[EHRPatientId] within the directory name is the unique identifier (e.g., Case Number / MRN) of the patient within the
EHR. Each patient subdirectory contains the following:

1. One Newline-Delimited JSON (NDJSON) file for each applicable resource. Each NDJSON file contains all data for
that resource related to the patient, formatted as described in the documentation.json file. Resource files are
only present in the patient subdirectory when patient data exists for that resource.
2. Files subdirectory , which contains exported, non-computable files that contain data related to the patient (e.g.,
scanned documents, PDFs, etc.). Resources that reference a file in this directory identify the file via property
fileName or imageName. The value of this property matches the name of the corresponding file in the Files
directory.

Introduction
The public-facing Web Service API provides an interface into the PCE Care Management Version 9.4 system for the
purposes of meeting criteria for ONC 2015 Edition Cures Update criteria test 170.315(g)(10). This API specification may
be used “out of the box” upon approval of an API request by the appropriate parties. Alternatively, other APIs (using
other standards, protocols, or customized APIs) are also available for implementation by contacting PCE Systems using
the PCE API Access Request Form in Appendix A. Requests may be sent to apirequests@pcesystems.com. Use of this API
and any other API is subject to the Terms of Use in Appendix B.

Registration
You may request access to the API by submitting a written request to PCE Systems using the PCE API Access Request
Form in Appendix A. This form may be submitted by e-mail to apirequests@pcesystems.com.
Registered applications must be confidential and server-based. Security credentials and fixed end-point URLs (“Launch”
URI and redirect URI(s)) are required from the registered application to receive authorization and access data.
Registered applications must support TLS 1.2 for all transactions and PKCE for authorization and authentication
requests. An active email address, phone number, and contact information must be received for communications and
error reporting going forward.
Upon granting of a request for access to the API, security credentials, including JWT secrets when applicable, will be
issued and endpoint URLs will be shared with the registered application. This will include two “Base URLs”, one for
production and one for testing purposes. The production URL will not be enabled until applicable testing is completed
and the exchange partner is approved to move to production. Additionally an email address will be provided for further
communications and error reporting.

How to Use the API
This API uses REST technology with OAuth2 for authorization and JWKS asymmetric authentication for client
authentication.
Request operations are listed in the API Operations section. Each request operation has its own URL, which starts with
the Base URL. Search criteria for each request operation are given via REST URL parameters, which are case-sensitive.
Applicable URL parameters are outlined for each request operation in the API Operations section.
Clinical data returned by the API is formatted as JSON based on FHIR v4.0.1 §170.215(a)(4) Argonaut Data Query
specification. The top level data element is always a Request object which contains the data requested, a version
identifier for the data and data format returned, a status flag which determines whether the request passed validations,
and informational Message Data Elements if the request does not pass validations.
JSON Data types returned by request operations are identified for each request operation in the API Operations section.
Data types are defined in detail in the Data Elements section.
The API’s capability statement can be found here: [Base URL]/MUPIX/v2/Capability
The API’s SMART-configuration file can be found here: [Base URL]/MUPIX/v2/.well-known/smart-configuration.json
The API’s public JWKS can be found here: [Base URL]/MUPIX/v2/.well-known/jwks.json

Key details:\n\n**Export mechanism:** The export is initiated by \"authorized EHR users\" and can export data per patient or for all patients. This is a purpose-built export function, not a repurposed FHIR Bulk Data endpoint.\n\n**Export format:** Password-protected ZIP files containing:\n1. `meta.json` — metadata about the export process (who ran it, when)\n2. `documentation.json` — a self-describing JSON schema containing all resource definitions, property names, data types, and descriptions\n3. `Patient_[EHRPatientId]/` subdirectories — one per patient, each containing:\n   - NDJSON files for each resource type (one file per resource, only present when data exists)\n   - A `Files/` subdirectory with non-computable files (scanned documents, PDFs, etc.)\n\n**Data types supported:** CLOB, DATE, DECIMAL, INTEGER, RESOURCE (cross-references between resources), STRING, TIMESTAMP.\n\n**Critical design decision:** The actual data dictionary — the list of resources and their fields — is **not** in the public documentation. It's embedded in the `documentation.json` file within the export ZIP itself. The public documentation describes the *format* of the schema but not the *content*. This means the specific resources, field names, and data types are only knowable by performing an actual export.\n\nThe documentation explicitly mentions cross-references between resources via the RESOURCE data type (which contains a `resource` name and `id` for linking), and file references via `fileName` or `imageName` properties that map to files in the `Files/` subdirectory.\n\n### API Documentation — 87 pages\n\nThe API documentation (updated April 23, 2025) covers the (g)(10) FHIR API. While this is not the (b)(10) export, it provides the only publicly visible enumeration of data elements PCE stores. The API exposes these FHIR resources:\n\n- AllergyIntolerance, CarePlan, CareTeam, Claim, Condition, Coverage, Device, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, Encounter, Goal, HealthcareService, Immunization, Location, MedicationRequest, Observation, Organization, Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Procedure, Provenance\n\nPlus a \"Message\" data element listed separately.\n\nThe Data Elements section (pages 65-78) provides field-level definitions for each resource: attribute name, data type, and description. These conform to US Core profiles.\n\nNotably, the API also includes **Claim** and **Coverage** resources, which go beyond the standard USCDI v1 data classes — suggesting PCE does store and expose billing/insurance data.\n\n### FHIR CapabilityStatement (machine-readable)\n\nThe production CapabilityStatement at the live endpoint confirms the same resource set. It declares conformance to US Core Server and FHIR Bulk Data CapabilityStatements.\n\n## Export Coverage Assessment\n\n### Data Domain Coverage\n\nThis is where PCE's approach has a fundamental gap. The (b)(10) documentation describes the export *container format* but deliberately defers the data dictionary to the export artifact itself (`documentation.json`). This makes a public coverage assessment nearly impossible.\n\n**What we can infer from the FHIR API (which is the (g)(10) system, not (b)(10)):**\n\nThe API covers standard USCDI v1 clinical data classes plus Claims and Coverage. However, the product research reveals PCE Care Management stores significantly more:\n\n**Likely covered (based on FHIR API resources):**\n- Patient demographics\n- Allergies and intolerances\n- Conditions/problems\n- Medications\n- Immunizations\n- Procedures\n- Vital signs, lab results, smoking status\n- Clinical notes and documents (including scanned files)\n- Care plans and care teams\n- Goals\n- Encounters\n- Claims and insurance coverage\n- Provider/organization/location data\n\n**Likely missing or uncertain (based on product research):**\n- **Treatment plans** — behavioral health-specific individualized treatment plans (beyond the FHIR CarePlan structure)\n- **Clinical assessments** — MichiCANS and other structured assessment instruments that are core to behavioral health practice\n- **Intake and discharge records** — formal admission/discharge documentation\n- **Incident reports** — required by CMH agencies for safety reporting\n- **Consent directives** — the eConsent Management System for 42 CFR Part 2 and Michigan Mental Health Code, which is a major feature of the system\n- **PIX/HIE exchange records** — cross-agency data sharing logs\n- **Audit logs** — system access and activity logs\n- **Scheduling/appointments** — referenced in the ONC Brightspot case study\n- **Messages** — the API docs mention a Message data element but it's not in the FHIR CapabilityStatement\n- **Social service referrals** — PCE signed MiHIN's Interoperable Referrals Pledge\n- **Authorization/prior-auth workflows** — expected for Medicaid behavioral health services\n\nThe key uncertainty is: **we don't know if the (b)(10) export includes all of these**. The export documentation says the `documentation.json` file contains \"a list of all possible resource definitions\" — the word \"all\" is encouraging, but without seeing the actual file, we can't verify this. The (b)(10) export could export far more than the FHIR API exposes, or it could be essentially the same set.\n\nThe explicit inclusion of a `Files/` subdirectory for non-computable content (scanned documents, PDFs) is a positive sign — it shows PCE thought about data that doesn't fit into structured NDJSON.\n\n### Export Format & Standards\n\nPCE has made a **good design choice** for (b)(10): they use their own structured format (NDJSON in ZIP files with a self-describing JSON schema) rather than repurposing their FHIR API. This is appropriate because:\n\n- The FHIR API is constrained to US Core profiles, which can't represent behavioral health-specific data\n- A vendor-native format can include every table and field in the system\n- NDJSON is computable and processable\n- The self-describing `documentation.json` schema means the export is self-documenting\n- Cross-references between resources are supported via the RESOURCE type\n- Non-computable files are included in a separate directory\n\nThe format is not a recognized standard, but it's well-designed for its purpose. A developer could parse the NDJSON files using the schema definitions in `documentation.json` and reconstruct relationships between entities.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\nThis is where PCE falls short. The public documentation is:\n\n- **3 pages** describing only the container format\n- **No data dictionary** — no enumeration of resources, fields, types, or descriptions\n- **No sample data** — no example `documentation.json` or sample NDJSON records\n- **No user guide** — no instructions for how to initiate the export, who can run it, or how long it takes\n- **No screenshots** of the export interface\n\nThe documentation essentially says \"the export is a ZIP file with NDJSON and a schema — run it and find out what's in it.\" This is a self-describing format, which has technical merit, but it means a third party cannot evaluate the export's completeness without actually running it.\n\nThe API documentation (87 pages) is substantially better — it has field-level definitions, data types, descriptions, and instructions. But that's (g)(10), not (b)(10).\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\nThe *format specification* is complete: data types, directory structure, file naming, cross-reference mechanism, and non-computable file handling are all documented.\n\nThe *content specification* is entirely absent from public documentation. There are:\n- No resource names listed\n- No field definitions\n- No value sets or coded field documentation\n- No relationship diagrams\n- No change history beyond the single revision date\n\nPCE's approach — embedding the schema in the export itself — is technically sound (it means the schema always matches the data), but it fails the transparency test. A patient, provider, or third-party developer cannot assess what the export contains without having an export in hand.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nPCE Systems has built a **thoughtful (b)(10) export mechanism** — a self-describing, structured format with NDJSON, cross-references, and non-computable file support. This is better engineering than many vendors who simply repackage their FHIR Bulk Data API.\n\nHowever, the **public documentation is minimal to the point of opacity**. Three pages describing only the container format, with zero enumeration of what data is actually exported. The self-describing nature of `documentation.json` is a partial mitigation (the schema travels with the data), but it doesn't help anyone evaluate coverage before performing an export.\n\nThe vendor clearly understands the distinction between (b)(10) and (g)(10) — they have separate documentation and separate mechanisms. But the (b)(10) documentation needs substantial expansion: a public data dictionary (even a summary), sample files, and user instructions would transform it from a format spec into actual export documentation.\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL (after redirects): https://www.pcesystems.com/g10APIInfo.html (no redirects)\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no\n- Navigation complexity: direct_link (two clearly labeled PDF links on the landing page)\n- Anti-bot issues: none\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\n\nNone. The page loaded cleanly, both PDFs downloaded without issues, and the FHIR CapabilityStatement was publicly accessible. The only obstacle is the deliberate decision to not publish the data dictionary publicly — it's embedded in the export artifact itself.\n"
