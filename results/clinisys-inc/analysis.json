    "description": "Clinisys (formerly Orchard Software Corporation) is a standalone laboratory information system (LIS) vendor — not an EHR. Clinisys Harvest and Clinisys Orchard (Enterprise) are laboratory information systems used by clinical labs, public health labs, toxicology labs, and anatomic pathology labs. They manage lab orders, specimen tracking, test processing, result verification, and result delivery. The products integrate WITH external EHRs (Epic, Cerner, etc.) via HL7 interfaces but do not replace them. Orchard Enterprise is the current flagship product; Harvest is the predecessor being sunsetted. The products also include: a patient portal (lab results only), a provider web portal (Orchard Outreach for order entry/results), billing code generation (CPT codes sent to external billing systems), quality control tracking, audit event logging, and public health reporting. There is no patient scheduling, no clinical notes, no medication management, no problem lists — these are purely lab-focused systems. The certified module IS essentially the whole product (the LIS), not a component of something larger.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "The export is documented as HL7 v2.3 ORU^R01 messages (unsolicited observation results). This is essentially an HL7 interface specification for transmitting lab results to an external system, not a database dump or file-based export. The HL7 messages contain: message headers (MSH), patient identification (PID with demographics), patient visit info (PV1), common order segments (ORC with ordering provider, draw dates), observation requests (OBR with lab orders, specimen info, CPT codes), and observation results (OBX with test results, units, ranges, abnormal flags). The export uses standard HL7 v2.3 segment/field structure with pipe delimiters. This approach covers lab results data comprehensively but is narrowly scoped to 'results export' — it does not appear to cover the full range of data the LIS stores (specimen tracking workflow events, quality control data, audit logs, pathology reports, instrument data, etc.). Notably, the sister Sunquest product line has a much more comprehensive native data export (pipe-delimited flat file covering demographics, blood bank data, orders, accessions, test components, results, and historical data), but no equivalent is documented for Orchard/Harvest.",

  "documentation_quality": {
    "description": "The documentation consists of two HL7 interface specification PDFs (15 pages for Enterprise, 13 pages for Harvest). Each document provides field-level detail for every HL7 segment used: segment name, field number, field name, Orchard-specific field name, field length, and comments explaining content/format. Data types are implicit from HL7 v2.3 standard. The documentation includes example messages showing actual field formatting. However, the documentation is narrowly scoped to the HL7 results export interface only — it does not document the full LIS data model, database schema, or any data categories beyond what flows through the results interface. There are no value set definitions beyond basic codes (M/F for sex, I/O for patient class). No relationships between entities are documented beyond the parent-child structure inherent in the HL7 message hierarchy. The documents were revised in 2021 (Enterprise) and 2023 (Harvest), predating some of the ONC EHI requirements timeline.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "The export documentation covers only lab results transmitted via HL7 ORU messages. This is a very narrow slice of the data a laboratory information system stores. The LIS is not an EHR, so many traditional EHI categories (clinical notes, medications, problem lists) are not applicable — the system genuinely doesn't store them. However, even within the LIS domain, the export documentation appears to miss significant data categories that the product DOES store: specimen tracking workflow events, quality control data, instrument interface data, pathology reports (anatomic pathology module), audit trails (the product is certified for d(2) auditable events), patient portal access logs, and provider portal activity. The billing code generation capability is partially covered (CPT codes appear in OBR fields), but the full billing workflow isn't documented. The product has audit trail capabilities (certified under d(2) and d(3)), but audit data is not covered in the export. Given that this is a standalone LIS, many categories are legitimately N/A, but the export still appears incomplete for the data the system actually stores.",
    "clinical": {
      "present": true,
      "evidence": "Lab results are the primary content of the export. The HL7 ORU messages contain: PID (patient demographics including name, DOB, sex, SSN, race, address, phone), PV1 (patient visit with admit/discharge dates, attending/referring physicians, patient class), ORC (common order with ordering provider, draw dates), OBR (observation requests with lab orders, specimen source, collection dates, CPT codes, ordering provider), OBX (observation results with test codes, values, units, reference ranges, abnormal flags, LOINC codes). Also supports embedded PDF results for microbiology and AP reports. Diagnoses are captured in the ordering context. However, the export only covers lab-domain clinical data — no medications, problem lists, allergies, vitals, or clinical notes (which the LIS doesn't store anyway)."
    },
    "secure_messages": {
      "present": false,
      "evidence": "No messaging content in the HL7 result export specification. The product has a patient portal for lab results access and an Orchard Outreach provider portal, but any communications through these portals are not covered in the export documentation. Searched for: message, inbox, communication, chat, portal, correspondence — none found in the export specs."
    },
    "billing_financial": {
      "present": false,
      "evidence": "CPT codes appear in OBR fields (OBR-45 Procedure Code Modifier and billing-related fields), and ORC-20 contains an 'Advance Beneficiary Notice Code' field. There is also a 'Billing ID' field and 'Financial Class' in PV1. However, there are no actual dollar amounts, charges, claims, payments, or transaction records in the export. The product generates billing codes for integration with external billing systems — the export includes the CPT code assignments but not the full billing data. Harvest Pathology explicitly mentions 'automated billing processes' as a product feature, but this data is not represented in the export."
    },
    "insurance_coverage": {
      "present": false,
      "evidence": "No insurance, coverage, eligibility, authorization, or payer information in the export documentation. The HL7 message structure does not include IN1 (Insurance) or IN2 segments, though these exist in the HL7 v2.3 standard. PV1 has a 'Financial Class' field which is the closest proxy, but no actual insurance data."
    },
    "appointments_scheduling": {
      "present": false,
      "evidence": "No appointment or scheduling data in the export. The LIS does not appear to have patient scheduling functionality — it tracks specimen collection events (OBR-7 Observation Date/Time, OBR-14 Specimen Received Date/Time) but these are lab workflow timestamps, not appointments. The product does not have a scheduling module."
    },
    "documents_images": {
      "present": true,
      "evidence": "The OBX segment supports embedded PDF documents. The Harvest spec notes: 'Result messages may be output containing embedded PDF files. See Encoded PDF Document notes following the OBX segment specification.' The Enterprise spec also documents OBX-5 as supporting 'ED' (embedded document) value type with Base64-encoded PDF content. This covers pathology reports and microbiology formatted reports. However, other document types that the LIS may store (scanned requisitions, uploaded images, faxed results) are not documented in the export."
    },
    "audit_trails": {
      "present": false,
      "evidence": "No audit trail data in the HL7 result export specification. Critically, the product IS certified for 170.315(d)(2) 'Auditable Events and Tamper-Resistance' and 170.315(d)(3) 'Audit Report(s)' — the certification page states these create 'logs of events related to disclosure of PHI' viewable in Microsoft Excel. This audit data exists in the system but is not included in the EHI export documentation. This is a notable gap: the product stores audit data (per its own certification) but the export doesn't cover it."

  "issues": [
    "The export documentation describes an HL7 v2.3 results interface specification, not a comprehensive EHI data export — it covers only lab results flowing through the ORU message, not all data stored by the LIS.",
    "The product is certified for 170.315(d)(2) auditable events and 170.315(d)(3) audit reports, confirming audit data exists in the system, but no audit data is included in the export documentation.",
    "The product has a patient portal and provider portal (Orchard Outreach), but no portal activity, access logs, or communications are covered in the export.",
    "Specimen tracking workflow data (collection, routing, processing, aliquoting events with timestamps and technician IDs) is a core LIS function but only partially captured via OBR timestamp fields — the full workflow history is not exported.",
    "Quality control data, instrument interface data, and competency records stored by the LIS are not represented in the export documentation.",
    "The Orchard/Harvest export documentation is significantly less comprehensive than the Sunquest SQ Lab export documentation (Patient-Data-Export-Specification) available on the US ONC disclosure page for a different Clinisys product line, suggesting the vendor has the capability to provide more complete export documentation but hasn't done so for Orchard/Harvest.",
    "The Enterprise export specification was last revised in 2021, predating the ONC's October 2022 EHI export information blocking compliance date, raising questions about whether the documentation has been updated for the Cures Act requirement.",
    "The documentation title 'HL7 Result Export' and scope statement 'export of Results from Orchard Enterprise Products' explicitly limits the scope to results only, not all EHI."

  "summary": "Clinisys Harvest and Orchard are standalone laboratory information systems (not EHRs) with EHI export documentation limited to HL7 v2.3 results interface specifications. The export covers lab results, patient demographics, and basic ordering data via standard HL7 ORU messages, but omits significant LIS data categories including audit trails (which the product is certified to maintain), specimen tracking workflow data, quality control data, patient/provider portal activity, and pathology-specific data beyond embedded PDFs. The documentation is well-structured at the field level for what it covers, but its scope is explicitly limited to 'Results export' — a narrow interpretation of 'all EHI' for a system that stores considerably more data than just results.",

  "notes": "Clinisys also operates the Sunquest Laboratory product line with separate CHPL listings and a more comprehensive native data export specification (Patient-Data-Export-Specification.pdf) available at https://www.clinisys.com/us/en/onc-disclosure/. The Sunquest export covers patient demographics, blood bank data, ordering data, accession data, order codes with CPT codes, test components, reaction results, and historical results in a pipe-delimited native format — significantly more comprehensive than the Orchard/Harvest HL7-only export. This suggests Clinisys has the capability to provide more thorough EHI export documentation but has not done so for the Orchard/Harvest product line. The registered URL path (/uk/en/history/orchard/) notably uses the UK English locale, though the content is US-focused ONC certification material."
