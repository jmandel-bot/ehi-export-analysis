    "Single shared b(10) paragraph covers all four certified products with no differentiation",
    "Does not meet the spirit of 170.315(b)(10) documentation requirements — provides no information about what EHI is actually exported"
  ],
  "summary": "Imprivata's EHI export documentation consists of a single paragraph on their ONC certification disclosures page stating that users can export EHI in CSV format from the Report Results page, with configurable data fields governed by user roles. No data dictionary, field definitions, schema, or sample exports are provided. These products (Access Intelligence, Digital Identity Intelligence, FairWarning) are patient privacy monitoring and access auditing tools — not traditional clinical EHR systems — so their EHI is primarily audit/access log data rather than clinical records. The documentation is among the most minimal b(10) disclosures observed."
