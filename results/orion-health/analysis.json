        "description": "Orion Health Communicate is a Direct Secure Messaging (HISP) platform — not an EHR. It provides an EHNAC-accredited HISP service compliant with the Direct Project standards, offered as SaaS. It implements SMTP, IMAP, and Direct XDR edge protocols, enabling providers and hospitals to send encrypted clinical messages and documents to other members of trusted communities like the DirectTrust bundle. Messages may include notes, clinical data, structured data, C-CDAs, and other attachments. Communicate is a standalone product listed under 'Additional Products' in Orion Health's product suite, separate from their Digital Care Record (Amadeus), Digital Front Door (Virtuoso), and Health Intelligence Platform. The certified module IS the full product — it is not a component of a larger system. The data Communicate stores is inherently limited to messages sent and received through the service and their attachments. It does not store patient clinical records, billing data, insurance information, appointments, or other EHR-type data natively.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The EHI export is a manual, support-ticket-driven process. An HIE or HISP administrative user must raise a ticket through Orion Health's Support Tracker, providing patient identifiers and delivery preference. Orion Health operations staff then processes the request and delivers the export as an archive (ZIP). The archive contains, per patient, a mixture of .eml files (raw email messages) and attachments in their original format — primarily .xml and .zip files (XDM payloads), plus .pdf and image formats. This is essentially a native dump of the Direct messages and attachments stored in the system. Both single-patient and population-level exports are supported. The Real World Testing Plan describes the export as 'a computable format,' though .eml files require specialized parsing. There is no self-service export mechanism — the process depends on vendor staff fulfillment.",

It describes the process for requesting an export (raise a support ticket), the target audience (HIE/HISP admins), the requirements (Support Tracker access, patient identifiers, delivery address), and a brief description of what the export contains (.eml files and attachments). There is no data dictionary, no schema documentation, no field-level detail, no description of .eml metadata fields, no sample data, and no technical specification for interpreting the exported content. The Real World Testing Plan (2025) adds only that EHI export supports both individual and population exports in 'a computable format.' This is among the most minimal EHI export documentation encountered.",

        "overall_assessment": "Communicate is a messaging transport system, not an EHR. The export covers what the product actually stores — Direct Secure Messages (.eml files) and their attachments (C-CDAs, XML, PDFs, images). By definition, the export is comprehensive for messaging data since that is the product's sole function. However, the product does not store most EHI categories (billing, insurance, scheduling, clinical records) because those are not functions of a messaging HISP. The notable gap is audit trail data: Communicate is certified for 170.315 (d)(2) Auditable Events and (d)(3) Audit Reports, indicating the system does store audit data, but the export documentation does not mention including audit trails. The lack of any data dictionary or schema documentation makes it impossible to verify exactly what fields and metadata are included in the .eml exports.",

          "present": true,
          "evidence": "Clinical data is present only as message attachments — C-CDA documents, XML files, and XDM payloads that were transmitted through the system.

          "present": true,
          "evidence": "This is the core data type. The export contains .eml files which ARE the Direct Secure Messages exchanged between providers.

        "billing_financial": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "Not applicable. Communicate is a messaging HISP — it has no billing, claims, revenue cycle, or financial functionality. Subscription fees are at the organizational level, not per-patient. No billing data exists in the system to export."

          "present": false,

        "documents_images": {
          "present": true,
          "evidence": "Message attachments are included in the export in their original format.

However, the EHI export documentation makes no mention of including audit trails, message delivery tracking, access logs, or any audit metadata in the export. This is a potential gap — the system stores audit data but may not include it in the EHI export."

      "issues": [
        "Export is not self-service: requires raising a support ticket through Orion Health's Support Tracker and waiting for operations staff to process it, introducing delays and human dependency.",

        "Audit data appears excluded: despite being certified for (d)(2) auditable events and (d)(3) audit reports, the export documentation does not mention inclusion of audit trails or access logs.",
        "Export format questionable for 'computable' claim: .eml files are raw email format documents that require specialized email clients or parsers. While technically machine-readable, they are not a standard structured data format like CSV, JSON, or FHIR.",
        "2024 Real World Testing Results do not include EHI export metrics: only (h)(2) Direct messaging metrics appear in the results table, raising questions about whether EHI export was actually tested in production.",
        "No documentation of message metadata included in export: unclear whether delivery status, timestamps, sender/recipient details, routing information, or message disposition notifications are preserved in the .eml files."

  "summary": "Orion Health Communicate is a Direct Secure Messaging HISP — a specialized message transport service, not an EHR. Its EHI export provides ZIP archives of .eml (email) files and message attachments in their original format. The export is manual (requires a support ticket to Orion Health operations staff), has extremely minimal documentation (~150 words, no data dictionary or schema), and does not document inclusion of audit trail data despite the system being certified for auditable events. The narrow data scope is inherent to the product rather than a compliance gap — the product genuinely only stores messages and attachments — but the manual process, absent documentation, and potential audit trail exclusion are concerns.",

  "notes": "Communicate's certified criteria are dominated by (h)(2) Direct Project/Edge Protocol/XDR/XDM, with (b)(10) EHI Export, (d)(1)/(d)(2)/(d)(3)/(d)(12)/(d)(13) security criteria, and (g)(4)/(g)(5) quality/accessibility. There are no clinical criteria like (a)(1)-(a)(14), no API criteria like (g)(7)-(g)(10), and no patient portal criteria like (e)(1). This confirms Communicate is a messaging infrastructure tool, not a clinical system. The product does not store the Designated Record Set in the traditional sense — it stores messages that may contain portions of other systems' Designated Record Sets."
