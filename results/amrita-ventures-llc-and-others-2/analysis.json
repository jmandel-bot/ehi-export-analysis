    "description": "Darena Health (formerly MeldRx, formerly BlueButtonPRO) is a FHIR middleware and compliance platform — NOT an EHR. It provides ONC-certified modules that EHR vendors integrate with to achieve certification. The platform handles FHIR API compliance (g10), EHI export (b10), clinical decision support (b11), and MIPS reporting. The 11 products listed in this certification are separate, independent EHR/practice management systems from 11 different developers that use Darena Health as their compliance layer. These products span radically different specialties: EZDERM (dermatology), PIMSY Platinum (behavioral health), eRAD RIS (radiology information), WITS (substance abuse treatment), Raintree (rehabilitation/therapy), Clinicmind (chiropractic/multi-specialty), Amrita (hospital information system), and others. Each of these products has its own patient portal, billing, scheduling, and specialty-specific functionality that stores data in its own database. Darena Health's FHIR layer only contains whatever data has been synchronized from those underlying systems — typically the USCDI-mapped clinical subset. This architecture means the EHI export almost certainly cannot access the full breadth of data stored by any of the 11 products.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Darena Health's EHI export uses FHIR Bulk Data Export (HL7 FHIR Bulk Data STU 1.0.1). The export is initiated via a Group-level $export operation on the FHIR server, producing NDJSON files of FHIR resources. Non-FHIR data is exported as DocumentReference resources (which can wrap C-CDA documents or other files). This is a pure FHIR-based export — there is no native database dump. The export can only contain data that has been loaded into the Darena Health FHIR workspace from the underlying EHR system. This is a significant limitation: the export is bounded by what the EHR-to-FHIR mapping covers, not by what the underlying EHR actually stores. For 11 different products across 11 specialties, the FHIR mapping is almost certainly limited to standard USCDI clinical data.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "Coverage is almost certainly severely incomplete for all 11 products. Darena Health is a FHIR middleware layer — it can only export data that has been mapped and synchronized from each underlying EHR into the FHIR workspace. Standard FHIR R4 resources cover clinical data reasonably well (diagnoses, medications, labs, allergies, vitals) but have significant gaps in billing detail, secure messaging, insurance authorization specifics, scheduling, audit trails, and specialty-specific data. Given that the 11 products span dermatology, behavioral health, radiology, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, and hospital settings, each with deep specialty-specific data models, the FHIR layer is almost certainly capturing only a fraction of each product's stored EHI. The documentation provides no list of exported resource types, making it impossible to verify coverage. The DocumentReference mechanism for non-FHIR data (e.g., C-CDA documents) provides a theoretical path for additional data but only if the underlying EHR has implemented that mapping — which is not documented.",

  "summary": "Darena Health is a FHIR middleware/compliance platform (not an EHR) that provides ONC-certified modules to 11 separate EHR products from 11 different developers across diverse specialties. Its b(10) EHI export documentation consists of just two sentences describing FHIR Bulk Data Export and DocumentReference-based non-FHIR export, with the referenced swagger link now dead (404). The FHIR-only export approach inherently limits coverage to data that has been mapped from each underlying EHR to the FHIR workspace, almost certainly missing billing, insurance, scheduling, secure messages, audit trails, and specialty-specific data that the underlying EHR products store.",

  "notes": "This is a particularly problematic case for EHI completeness. The b(10) requirement covers 'all EHI stored by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part.' The certified module (Darena Health) is a FHIR middleware layer that sits alongside — not inside — the actual EHR products. The products (Raintree, Clinicmind, EZDERM, etc.) are the systems that actually store patient data. Darena Health only sees what the EHR has pushed to it via FHIR/CCDA mappings. This creates a fundamental architectural gap: the certified module's export capability is limited to data that exists in the middleware layer, while the bulk of EHI remains in the underlying EHR databases that Darena Health has no direct access to. Each of the 11 products would need its own comprehensive data mapping to close this gap, and there is no documentation suggesting this has been done comprehensively for any of them."
