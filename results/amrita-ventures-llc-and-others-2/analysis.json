    "description": "Darena Health (formerly MeldRx, BlueButtonPRO) is NOT an EHR — it is a middleware FHIR API compliance platform. It provides pre-certified ONC modules that other EHR vendors integrate with to achieve certification. The platform is a multi-tenant cloud SaaS where EHR vendors push patient data into Darena's FHIR data store, and Darena handles certified API access and EHI export. Eleven different EHR products from eleven different developers all share this single Darena certification, covering a remarkable range of specialties: dermatology (EZDERM), behavioral health (PIMSY Platinum, Office Anywhere), physical therapy (Raintree), radiology (eRAD RIS), substance abuse treatment (WITS), epidemiology (Epi-Management), and general ambulatory (UnifiMD, Clinicmind, Doctorsoft, Amrita). Each of these downstream EHR products has its own native data stores with billing, scheduling, messaging, document management, and specialty-specific data. The critical issue is that the Darena-based EHI export can only export data that each EHR has mapped and pushed into the Darena FHIR platform — which is likely limited to clinical data needed for USCDI/FHIR compliance.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Darena's EHI export uses FHIR Bulk Export (HL7 FHIR Bulk Data STU1.0.1) for structured data, with DocumentReference resources as a catch-all for non-FHIR content including C-CDA documents. The export is API-based, not a traditional file download — users interact with the FHIR $Export operation via the API. The Swagger API shows an 'Export' operation in the FHIR operations enum. The internal data model (MyMipsScore.Core.Models) maps to approximately 60 models covering standard clinical FHIR resources: Patient, Allergy, Medication, Immunization, Observation, Procedure, CarePlan, CareTeam, Coverage, Communication, DiagnosticReport, Document, Goal, Device, ServiceRequest, Specimen, and related models. Notably absent from the internal data model are ANY billing/financial models, scheduling/appointment models, or audit trail models. This strongly suggests the export is limited to clinical FHIR resources and cannot include the full EHI that the downstream EHR products store.",

    "overall_assessment": "The Darena Health EHI export is fundamentally limited by its middleware architecture. As a FHIR API platform that sits between EHRs and their users, Darena can only export data that has been pushed into it by the upstream EHR. Darena's internal data model covers standard clinical FHIR resources (approximately 60 models), plus Coverage and Communication. However, it has ZERO billing/financial models (no Claim, ChargeItem, Payment, Invoice), ZERO scheduling models (no Appointment, Schedule, Slot), and ZERO audit models (no AuditEvent, Provenance). The downstream EHR products — many of which are full practice management systems with billing, scheduling, and patient portals — almost certainly store data in these categories that cannot be exported through Darena. The DocumentReference catch-all could theoretically contain billing statements or other documents as attached files, but this would be PDF/binary content, not structured machine-readable data. This is a structural gap inherent to the middleware certification model: the certified module (Darena) doesn't have access to the full data stored by the product it's a part of.",

  "summary": "Darena Health is a middleware FHIR API compliance platform — not an EHR — that 11 different EHR vendors use for ONC certification. The EHI export uses FHIR Bulk Export with DocumentReference as a catch-all for non-FHIR content. Darena's internal data model covers ~60 clinical models but has zero billing, scheduling, or audit trail models, creating significant coverage gaps for downstream products that are full practice management systems. The documentation is minimal (two sentences), with no product-specific data dictionary for any of the 11 certified products.",

  "notes": "This is a notable example of the 'shared certification' pattern, where a middleware vendor provides a pre-certified FHIR module that multiple EHR vendors embed. While this is efficient for certification, it creates a structural problem for b(10) compliance: the certified module (Darena) sits outside the EHR's native data store and can only export data that has been explicitly pushed to it. For the typical integration, this means USCDI-level clinical data gets exported, but billing, scheduling, messaging, audit trails, and specialty-specific data that lives only in the EHR's native database does not. The FHIR ResourceType enum in the Swagger spec includes the full FHIR R4 resource list (including Claim, Appointment, AuditEvent, etc.) but Darena's internal data model — which reflects what the platform actually stores — lacks models for these resource types. The DocumentType enum is limited to 11 clinical note types (DischargeSummary, ConsultNote, ProgressNote, etc.) with no billing documents, insurance forms, or administrative records. The Communication model exists and could theoretically represent portal messages, but it has minimal fields and it's unclear whether actual message content flows through it."
