    "description": "Darena Health (formerly MeldRx, BlueButtonPRO) is NOT an EHR — it is a FHIR middleware platform. It provides ONC-certified API modules as a SaaS service that EHR vendors integrate to achieve ONC certification compliance. Darena Health describes itself as 'the nation's first ONC Certified FHIR API.' The 11 products listed in CHPL are the actual EHR systems that use Darena Health as their certified module. These range widely: a hospital information system (Amrita HIS), specialty EHRs (ophthalmology — Doctorsoft, dermatology — EZDERM, behavioral health — PIMSY/Office Anywhere, physical therapy — Raintree), a radiology information system (eRAD RIS), a substance abuse treatment system (WITS), a public health system (Epi-Management), and full practice management suites with billing (Clinicmind, UnifiMD). Every one of these products stores substantial data beyond clinical documentation — billing/claims, scheduling, specialty-specific workflows, patient portals, document management, state reporting — that the underlying EHR databases contain but that Darena Health's FHIR middleware layer almost certainly does not have access to.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Darena Health's EHI export is entirely FHIR-based. It uses two mechanisms: (1) FHIR Bulk Export for structured data, producing NDJSON files per the FHIR Bulk Data standard (STU 1.0.1), and (2) DocumentReference FHIR resources for non-FHIR content (which can wrap any file, including C-CDA documents). Because Darena Health is middleware — not the EHR itself — it can only export data that EHR vendors have pushed into its FHIR server. It has no direct access to the underlying EHR databases. This creates a fundamental architectural limitation: the export is bounded by whatever FHIR resources each vendor chose to map and send to Darena Health, not by what the EHR actually stores. This is the weakest possible export architecture for EHI completeness — the middleware cannot know what it doesn't have.",

The linked swagger documentation (app.meldrx.com/swagger) returns 404. The docs.darena.health site is a Postman-hosted API portal with general integration guidance, but it does not document what data is in the EHI export or what FHIR resources are supported for bulk export.

At best, the export contains standard FHIR R4/US Core clinical resources (Patient, Condition, MedicationRequest, Observation, AllergyIntolerance, Procedure, Immunization, DiagnosticReport, etc.) plus DocumentReference wrappers for non-FHIR content like C-CDA documents. At worst, it contains only what was minimally needed for g(10) API certification. Given the middleware architecture, the export almost certainly does not include billing line items, insurance authorization details, scheduling data, patient-provider messages, specialty-specific data, or audit trails — data that every one of these 11 products stores but that would not typically be mapped to FHIR resources and pushed to a third-party middleware platform. The gap between what these products store and what this export likely contains is enormous.",

  "summary": "Darena Health is a FHIR middleware platform — not an EHR — that provides ONC-certified modules to 11 diverse EHR products ranging from hospital systems to dermatology to radiology to substance abuse treatment. The EHI export documentation is essentially nonexistent: two sentences describing FHIR Bulk Export and DocumentReference, with no data dictionary and dead swagger links. The middleware architecture means the export can only contain what each vendor pushes into the FHIR server, creating a fundamental gap between what these products actually store (billing, scheduling, messages, specialty data, images, audit trails) and what the export can provide. This is one of the weakest EHI export implementations encountered — inadequate documentation, architectural limitations preventing completeness, and a one-size-fits-all approach for 11 radically different products.",

  "notes": "The middleware certification model raises a systemic concern: Darena Health achieves b(10) certification, and then 11 EHR vendors claim compliance by integrating with it. But b(10) requires export of 'all EHI stored by the product of which the Health IT Module is a part.' If the certified module (Darena Health) is part of a product (e.g., Clinicmind), then the export must include ALL data from Clinicmind — including billing, scheduling, messages, etc. A FHIR middleware layer that only receives clinical FHIR resources from the EHR cannot satisfy this requirement. Each of the 11 products would need to ensure all their data is pushed to Darena Health, which is architecturally impractical. The ONC certification page mentions 'MeldRx is now Darena Health' — the company has rebranded at least twice (BlueButtonPRO → MeldRx → Darena Health)."
