      "description": "AI-driven population health management, care coordination, data aggregation, and analytics platform. Not a primary EHR — integrates bi-directionally with 80+ EHRs and aggregates clinical, claims, and other data into a unified longitudinal patient record. Includes care management workflows, quality reporting (eCQM/MIPS/HEDIS), risk adjustment (HCC/RAF), patient engagement (portal/app/RPM), provider point-of-care tool (CareTrak), and electronic lab order/result exchange (SmartLab/ETOR). Serves ACOs, physician groups, hospitals, payers, Medicare Advantage plans, and state public health departments.",

EHI export uses XML/CCD and QRDA Cat I format which may not capture care management, messaging, custom forms, quality calculations, risk scores, claims data, RPM data, or other platform-specific data. Two certified versions: v4.0 (narrower CDS-focused certification) and v3.5 (broader clinical data + API certification).",

  "notes": "Persivia is a population health and value-based care technology company, not a traditional EHR vendor. Founded 2015 in Marlborough, MA. The platform (CareSpace) sits on top of existing EHRs rather than replacing them. SmartLab/ETOR component has been in production with Massachusetts and Iowa Departments of Public Health for 15+ years (predating the company itself — likely inherited from founding team's prior work). NCQA Certified Data Aggregator, HITRUST certified, SOC 2 Type 2. CMS Certified Quality Registry. Gartner-recognized for Health Data Management Platform and AI-enabled Solutions."
