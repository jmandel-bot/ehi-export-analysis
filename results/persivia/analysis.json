    "No data dictionary or schema: The EHI export documentation is a few sentences of prose with no field-level detail whatsoever.",
    "Inconsistent export format claims: Platform 4.0 says QRDA Cat I (a quality reporting format), Platform 3.5 says CCD (a clinical summary format). Neither is a comprehensive EHI export format.",
    "QRDA Cat I is not an EHI format: QRDA Cat I exports clinical quality measure data, not 'all electronic health information.' This appears to conflate the (c)(1-3) CQM criteria with the (b)(10) EHI export criterion.",
    "CCD/C-CDA is limited: While more comprehensive than QRDA, C-CDA CCD does not include billing, insurance, scheduling, messages, audit trails, or custom/specialty data.",
    "No mention of how non-clinical data is exported or whether it is included at all.",
    "No sample exports, developer guides, or processing tools provided.",
    "Documentation appears to be compliance boilerplate rather than genuine technical documentation."
  ],
  "summary": "Persivia's EHI export documentation consists of a few paragraphs of inline text on their certified products page. Platform 4.0 claims to export in QRDA Cat I XML format (a quality measure reporting format, not a comprehensive EHI format). Platform 3.5 claims to export CCD (C-CDA XML) files for single or multiple patients. There is no data dictionary, field-level documentation, schema, or downloadable specification. The documentation provides no evidence that the export covers 'all EHI' as required by 170.315(b)(10) — both formats described are standardized clinical document formats that exclude billing, insurance, messaging, scheduling, audit, and other non-clinical data."
