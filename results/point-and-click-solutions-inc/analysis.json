        "description": "PNC Suite is a comprehensive, purpose-built Electronic Health Records / Practice Management System designed specifically for college and university student health and counseling centers. Founded in 1990, Point and Click Solutions serves 350+ university sites with 10,000+ users internationally (U.S., Canada, Australia). The company was acquired by Banyan Software in August 2025. PNC Suite is a full-featured ambulatory EHR/PMS that includes clinical charting (300+ templates), e-prescribing, lab/EKG interfaces, a patient web portal with secure messaging and online appointment booking, comprehensive practice management (registration integrated with campus systems like Banner/PeopleSoft, drag-and-drop scheduling, automated check-in), billing (cashiering, bursar billing, insurance billing, electronic claims, remittance), and a dedicated counseling module with DSM-5 coding, survey instruments (PHQ9, CCAPS), and firewalled counseling charts. The ONC certification is intentionally minimal — covering only (b)(10) EHI export and security/privacy criteria — because the college health market has little overlap with Medicare/Medicaid Promoting Interoperability incentive programs. The product itself is vastly more capable than the certification footprint suggests.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "PNC Suite exports patient data as FHIR R4 JSON files using the Patient/$everything operation pattern. PNC data fields are mapped to standard FHIR resources: clinical data to structured resources (AllergyIntolerance, Condition, Observation, etc.), and most document types to the generic DocumentReference resource. The vendor explicitly acknowledges mapping challenges between their native data fields and FHIR R4, especially for financial data, and plans to upgrade to R5 for improved coverage. The export requires an API interface service to be configured (at potential cost) via a support ticket. Once configured, single-patient exports are self-service via the PncChart/Facility view; population exports may require developer assistance. This is a FHIR resource export, not a native database dump — meaning the export is constrained by what FHIR R4 can represent, and many data types are flattened into DocumentReference blobs rather than preserving native structured fields.",

The clinical coverage is strong with dedicated FHIR resources for core clinical data types. However, the FHIR R4 approach introduces constraints: many data types are flattened into generic DocumentReference resources (losing structural detail), financial data mapping is acknowledged as incomplete by the vendor, and insurance/coverage data appears absent despite the product's extensive insurance billing capabilities. Two significant compliance concerns exist: (1) records flagged as 'Hidden' from the patient portal are excluded from the EHI export, which conflates portal visibility with Designated Record Set obligations, and (2) entire 'sequestered' charts are excluded rather than just litigation-specific compilations. The counseling module's firewalled charts are not explicitly addressed in the export documentation, raising questions about whether counseling data is included.",

PNC Suite stores rich billing data (cashiering, bursar billing, insurance billing, claims, remittance, multiple fee schedules, capitated plans, automatic charge capture). The single Invoice mapping likely captures summary-level financial information but probably does not include the full granularity of charge line items, payment transactions, claim adjudication details, and adjustments. Vendor notes R5 will improve this."

Some insurance identifiers may be included in the Patient resource or Invoice, but dedicated coverage, plan, and authorization data does not appear to have a mapped export resource."

      "issues": [
        "Hidden records excluded from export: PNC excludes records flagged as 'Hidden' (which prevents display in the patient portal) from the b.10 FHIR export, stating they 'were hidden from the patient/client for a specific reason.' This conflates portal visibility with Designated Record Set obligations. A note hidden from the patient portal is still part of the medical record and should be included in an EHI export. This is a significant compliance concern.",
        "Sequestered charts entirely excluded: Charts flagged as 'Sequestered' (involved in legal proceedings) are excluded from the export. While HIPAA permits exclusion of 'information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a legal proceeding,' this typically means the compiled litigation materials, not the entire underlying medical record. Excluding the whole chart may be overbroad.",
        "Financial data mapping acknowledged as incomplete: PNC explicitly states FHIR R4 mapping was especially challenging for financial data. With only a single 'Financial Statements' → Invoice mapping, the rich billing data PNC Suite stores (charges, claims, payments, adjustments, bursar billing, insurance billing, remittance) is likely under-represented.",
        "Insurance/coverage data appears absent from export: Despite PNC Suite's comprehensive insurance and eligibility tracking capabilities, no dedicated Coverage or InsurancePlan resource is listed in the export mapping.",
        "API connection required at potential cost: Customers must submit a support ticket and may incur costs to establish the API connection for the export. While the standard allows 'reasonable time' for setup, this creates a barrier to access.",
        "No field-level documentation: The documentation maps data categories to FHIR resource types but provides no field-level detail, making it impossible to assess the completeness of the mapping from the documentation alone.",
        "Counseling chart inclusion unclear: PNC Suite maintains firewalled counseling charts separate from medical charts. The export documentation does not explicitly address whether counseling charts are included, and the 'Hidden' record exclusion policy could disproportionately affect counseling-related content."
      ],

      "summary": "PNC Suite is a comprehensive college health EHR/PMS whose EHI export maps 30 data categories to FHIR R4 JSON. Clinical coverage is strong, and the export commendably includes messages, appointments, documents, and financial statements. However, the FHIR R4 approach introduces mapping limitations the vendor explicitly acknowledges (especially for financial data), insurance/coverage data appears absent, and two exclusion policies — 'Hidden' records and 'Sequestered' charts — raise significant compliance concerns by potentially withholding Designated Record Set data from the export."

  "summary": "Point and Click Solutions provides a single 7-page PDF documenting their FHIR R4-based EHI export for PNC Suite, a comprehensive college/university health center EHR/PMS. The export maps 30 data categories to FHIR resources and covers clinical, messaging, scheduling, document, and financial data. Key concerns include the exclusion of 'Hidden' records from the export (conflating portal visibility with EHI obligations), acknowledged incomplete financial data mapping, absent insurance/coverage data, and the requirement for a potentially costly API setup. The documentation provides category-level mapping but no field-level detail.",

  "notes": "PNC Suite occupies an unusual niche — it is a full-featured EHR/PMS used exclusively by college and university health centers. Its ONC certification is intentionally minimal (only b.10 and security criteria), likely because the college health market doesn't participate in Medicare/Medicaid Promoting Interoperability programs. The product is far more capable than the certification footprint suggests, with extensive clinical, counseling, scheduling, billing, portal, and messaging features. The vendor's approach of using FHIR R4 for the export is thoughtful and forward-looking (they plan R5 upgrades), but the DocumentReference-heavy mapping means many data types lose structural fidelity. The 'Hidden' record exclusion policy is the most significant red flag — it essentially allows individual providers or system administrators to unilaterally exclude records from the EHI export by flagging them as 'Hidden,' which was designed as a portal visibility control, not an EHI export filter."
