The company was incorporated on November 18, 1999, and describes itself as founded by \"a team of experienced Physicians and Business professionals\" who understood the operational challenges of running medical practices. The BBB categorizes Radysans under \"medical billing,\" and their Alignable listing describes them as offering \"Integrated Health Records Software and RCM Services for outpatient clinics.\"\n     9→\n    10→Radysans is a very small vendor — no employee counts or revenue figures are publicly available, and the company has no presence on major review platforms like G2, Capterra, or KLAS. Key leadership includes Raj Polavaram (President/Owner) and Shekar Raju (COO). The company operates the EHR platform at ehr.cutecharts.com (a domain that appears to be their hosted application environment). One identifiable customer is Mann ENT, an otolaryngology practice in Cary/Clayton, North Carolina, whose patient portal runs on Radysans EHR (portal.entmann.com). Dr. Charles H. Mann is described as a member of the Senior Advisory Council of Radysans, Inc, suggesting a close relationship between the vendor and at least some of its customers. The company's stated mission is to \"become the most trusted and valued source for integrated Clinical Practice management solutions and services.\"\n    11→\n    12→## Product: Radysans EHR\n    13→\n    14→CHPL ID: 10253 (15.04.04.2912.Rady.05.00.1.191231)\n    15→\n    16→### What It Is\n    17→\n    18→Radysans EHR is an integrated ambulatory EHR and practice management platform targeting outpatient clinics and physician practices. The product is cloud-hosted (accessible via web browser at ehr.cutecharts.com) and offered as a SaaS subscription (\"a single, low monthly subscription fee\"). The current certified version is 5.0, though older instances (v3.0) are still visible at some customer portal URLs.\n    19→\n    20→The product is broadly certified across 40+ ONC criteria, including clinical data (a)(1)–(a)(15), transitions of care (b)(1)–(b)(2), patient portal/VDT (e)(1), clinical quality measures (c)(1)–(c)(4), public health reporting (f)(1)–(f)(2), and FHIR APIs (g)(7)–(g)(10).

Took a full-page screenshot of the certification page via browser.\n\n## What Was Found\n\n### The (b)(10) Document: B-10-Documentation.pdf\n\nThis is a single-page PDF titled \"Documentation for Export of Electronic Health Information — 170.315(b)(10) Electronic Health Information Export.\" It describes two export formats:\n\n**1. C-CDA Export**\nThe product supports \"bulk export of HL7 CCDA xml files which comply to United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), Version 1 requirements.\" The document lists 22 C-CDA sections exported:\n- Allergies, Adverse Reactions, Alerts\n- Assessment Plan\n- Chief Complaint\n- Cognitive Status\n- Demographics\n- Reason for Visit / Encounters\n- Family History\n- Functional Status\n- Goals\n- Health Concerns\n- Immunizations\n- Instructions\n- Lab Results\n- Medical Equipment UDI\n- Medications\n- Plan of Care\n- Problem List\n- Procedures\n- Reason for Referral\n- Social History\n- Plan of Treatment\n- Vitals\n\nThe document references the HL7 C-CDA specification for format details.\n\n**2. FHIR Export**\nThe document states: \"Radysans EHR also supports HL7® Version 4.0.1 FHIR® Release 4, October 30, 2019, FHIR® US Core Implementation Guide STU V3.1.1, HL7 FHIR Bulk Data export.\" It then directs the reader to the 170.315(g)(10) documentation for details.\n\n### The (g)(10) API Documentation: G10ApplicationAccessTermsandCondition.pdf\n\nThis is a detailed (~20+ pages) PDF documenting the FHIR R4 API. It covers:\n- OAuth 2.0 authorization flow (PKCE-based)\n- Token endpoints\n- All supported FHIR resources with URLs, parameters, and sample JSON responses:\n  - AllergyIntolerance, CarePlan, CareTeam, Condition, Device, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, Encounter, Goal, Immunization, MedicationRequest, Observation, Organization, Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Procedure, Provenance\n\nThe API base URL is `https://ehrwebapi.cutecharts.com/radywebapi/`. Sample outputs show US Core-profiled FHIR resources with coded data (SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm).\n\n### Mandatory Disclosure Statement: RadysansEHRCostsandLimitations.pdf\n\nRelevant finding: Under \"Data Portability\" it states: \"This capability will allow extraction of data\" with a cost of \"One-time fee per provider upon request of data extraction.\" This confirms there is a fee for EHI export.\n\n### FHIR Endpoint Bundle\n\nA valid FHIR Bundle containing a single Endpoint resource pointing to `https://ehrwebapi.cutecharts.com/radywebapi` and an Organization resource for Radysans Inc.\n\n## Export Coverage Assessment\n\n### Data Domain Coverage\n\nThe (b)(10) export documentation is a textbook example of the (b)(10)/(g)(10) conflation problem. The vendor describes their EHI export as consisting of two mechanisms — C-CDA documents and FHIR Bulk Data — both of which are standards-based clinical data exchange formats that cover only the USCDI/US Core data classes.\n\n**Clearly covered (via C-CDA + FHIR):**\n- Patient demographics\n- Problems/conditions\n- Medications\n- Allergies\n- Lab results (via DiagnosticReport, Observation)\n- Vital signs\n- Immunizations\n- Procedures\n- Encounters\n- Care plans and care teams\n- Goals\n- Social history\n- Family history\n- Medical devices/UDI\n- Clinical notes (via DocumentReference)\n- Provenance\n\n**Missing or not mentioned — based on product research:**\n- **Billing/claims data**: The product has a full eBilling module with charge capture, claim scrubbing, electronic claims submission, denial tracking, EOB/ERA processing, payment posting. None of this appears in the export.\n- **Appointment/scheduling data**: The PMS module includes enterprise scheduling across multiple locations and providers. Not in the export.\n- **Patient registration data**: Scanned documents (photos, insurance cards, regulatory documents). Not in the export.\n- **Referral and pre-authorization records**: The product has referral management. The C-CDA has a \"Reason for Referral\" section, but this is the clinical reason, not the administrative referral tracking data.\n- **Audit trails**: The product's security page mentions audit trails with user identification, date/time stamps. Not in the export.\n- **Message/task routing data**: The \"Message Manager\" workflow/task routing module data is absent.\n- **Business intelligence/reports**: KPI data, no-show/cancellation tracking, user productivity metrics — none exported.\n- **Transcription records**: The product offers transcription services with long-term storage. Not in the export.\n- **Insurance eligibility data**: Captured by the PMS. Not exported.\n- **Patient portal activity data**: Login records, patient representative access. Not exported.\n- **Clinical decision support configurations**: Alert settings, order sets, protocols. Not exported.\n\nThe export covers roughly the USCDI v1 clinical data subset — perhaps 30-40% of what the product actually stores. The administrative, financial, and operational data that makes up a significant portion of the system's data holdings is entirely absent.\n\n### Export Format & Standards\n\nThe export uses two standard clinical data formats:\n- **C-CDA** (HL7 Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture) — XML documents per patient with 22 sections\n- **FHIR R4** with US Core STU 3.1.1 profiles — 18 resource types via Bulk Data API\n\nBoth are well-recognized interoperability standards, but they are designed for clinical data exchange, not comprehensive data export. Neither format has a natural way to represent billing claims, appointment schedules, audit logs, insurance eligibility records, or most administrative data.\n\nThe FHIR resource types map exactly to the US Core required resources — this is the (g)(10) certified API being repurposed as the (b)(10) export mechanism. There are no custom FHIR profiles, no extensions for vendor-specific data, and no non-US-Core resources.\n\nA third party could reconstruct the clinical summary from this export, but could not reconstruct the full patient record including billing history, appointment history, referrals, or administrative data.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\n**The (b)(10) document itself is minimal** — a single page listing C-CDA sections and a pointer to the FHIR API docs. There is no data dictionary, no field-level documentation, no schema beyond \"C-CDA\" and \"FHIR US Core.\"\n\n**The (g)(10) API document is more detailed** — it includes endpoint URLs, parameter lists, and full sample JSON responses for each FHIR resource type. A developer could use this to implement a FHIR client. However, this is (g)(10) documentation, not (b)(10)-specific documentation.\n\nThere are no:\n- Worked examples of the C-CDA bulk export process\n- Instructions for how to initiate or receive the export\n- Data dictionaries mapping internal fields to export fields\n- Sample export files\n- Schema files (no XSD for C-CDA output, no FHIR StructureDefinitions)\n- Documentation of what data is NOT included in the export\n\nThe mandatory disclosure statement mentions a \"one-time fee per provider upon request of data extraction\" for Data Portability, which suggests the export may be a manual/on-request process rather than a self-service feature.\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\nThe documentation is extremely thin for a (b)(10) compliance artifact:\n- **Granularity**: Section/resource names only. No field-level documentation for the C-CDA export. The FHIR documentation shows sample outputs which implicitly document field structure, but only via examples, not formal definitions.\n- **Value sets**: Not documented beyond what's visible in FHIR sample data (standard terminologies: SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm, CVX).\n- **Relationships**: Not explicitly documented. The FHIR resources contain references to each other (e.g., Encounter references in MedicationRequest), following standard FHIR patterns.\n- **Versioning**: The document references \"Radysans EHR v 5.0\" and was created November 27, 2023 (per PDF metadata). No change history.\n\nThis looks like a compliance checkbox rather than a genuine effort to document comprehensive EHI export. The vendor has certified their existing C-CDA and FHIR capabilities as the (b)(10) mechanism, which satisfies the letter of having \"export documentation\" but falls far short of covering all electronic health information the system stores.\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL (after redirects): https://radysans.com/Radysans/ONCcertification.html\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no (all content accessible via curl)\n- Navigation complexity: direct_link (PDF linked directly from certification page)\n- Anti-bot issues: none\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\nNone. The page loaded cleanly, all PDF links worked, and the FHIR endpoint responded with valid JSON. The main issue is not accessibility but substance — the documentation is minimal and doesn't address comprehensive EHI export.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":397,"cache_read_input_tokens":81046,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":397},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f74f28c4-8c7d-4375-950e-f996f521f997","uuid":"c94ee14d-18dd-4c7c-91c3-9bade8f4df02"}

Not exported.\n\nThe export covers roughly the USCDI v1 clinical data subset — perhaps 30-40% of what the product actually stores. The administrative, financial, and operational data that makes up a significant portion of the system's data holdings is entirely absent.\n\n### Export Format & Standards\n\nThe export uses two standard clinical data formats:\n- **C-CDA** (HL7 Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture) — XML documents per patient with 22 sections\n- **FHIR R4** with US Core STU 3.1.1 profiles — 18 resource types via Bulk Data API\n\nBoth are well-recognized interoperability standards, but they are designed for clinical data exchange, not comprehensive data export. Neither format has a natural way to represent billing claims, appointment schedules, audit logs, insurance eligibility records, or most administrative data.\n\nThe FHIR resource types map exactly to the US Core required resources — this is the (g)(10) certified API being repurposed as the (b)(10) export mechanism. There are no custom FHIR profiles, no extensions for vendor-specific data, and no non-US-Core resources.\n\nA third party could reconstruct the clinical summary from this export, but could not reconstruct the full patient record including billing history, appointment history, referrals, or administrative data.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\n**The (b)(10) document itself is minimal** — a single page listing C-CDA sections and a pointer to the FHIR API docs. There is no data dictionary, no field-level documentation, no schema beyond \"C-CDA\" and \"FHIR US Core.\"\n\n**The (g)(10) API document is more detailed** — it includes endpoint URLs, parameter lists, and full sample JSON responses for each FHIR resource type. A developer could use this to implement a FHIR client. However, this is (g)(10) documentation, not (b)(10)-specific documentation.\n\nThere are no:\n- Worked examples of the C-CDA bulk export process\n- Instructions for how to initiate or receive the export\n- Data dictionaries mapping internal fields to export fields\n- Sample export files\n- Schema files (no XSD for C-CDA output, no FHIR StructureDefinitions)\n- Documentation of what data is NOT included in the export\n\nThe mandatory disclosure statement mentions a \"one-time fee per provider upon request of data extraction\" for Data Portability, which suggests the export may be a manual/on-request process rather than a self-service feature.\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\nThe documentation is extremely thin for a (b)(10) compliance artifact:\n- **Granularity**: Section/resource names only. No field-level documentation for the C-CDA export. The FHIR documentation shows sample outputs which implicitly document field structure, but only via examples, not formal definitions.\n- **Value sets**: Not documented beyond what's visible in FHIR sample data (standard terminologies: SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm, CVX).\n- **Relationships**: Not explicitly documented. The FHIR resources contain references to each other (e.g., Encounter references in MedicationRequest), following standard FHIR patterns.\n- **Versioning**: The document references \"Radysans EHR v 5.0\" and was created November 27, 2023 (per PDF metadata). No change history.\n\nThis looks like a compliance checkbox rather than a genuine effort to document comprehensive EHI export. The vendor has certified their existing C-CDA and FHIR capabilities as the (b)(10) mechanism, which satisfies the letter of having \"export documentation\" but falls far short of covering all electronic health information the system stores.\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL (after redirects): https://radysans.com/Radysans/ONCcertification.html\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no (all content accessible via curl)\n- Navigation complexity: direct_link (PDF linked directly from certification page)\n- Anti-bot issues: none\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\nNone. The page loaded cleanly, all PDF links worked, and the FHIR endpoint responded with valid JSON. The main issue is not accessibility but substance — the documentation is minimal and doesn't address comprehensive EHI export.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
