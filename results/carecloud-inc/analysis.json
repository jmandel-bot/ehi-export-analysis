    "description": "CareCloud, Inc. operates under the Medsphere brand and manages a portfolio of distinct healthcare IT products acquired over time. CareVue is a hospital/inpatient EHR derived from the VA's open-source VistA system, serving acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities, and rural/critical access hospitals. ChartLogic EHR is an ambulatory practice EHR with practice management (scheduling, billing), e-prescribing, a patient portal ('Connect Patient'), and revenue cycle management — a full ambulatory suite. Wellsoft EDIS is an Emergency Department Information System providing patient tracking, triage, clinical documentation, and medication management for hospital EDs. PCG (from Micro-Office Systems) is a patient portal/PHR product. CareCloud.com itself (www.carecloud.com) is now a separate entity offering cloud-based EHR, RCM, and practice management solutions, but the certified products are marketed under the Medsphere brand. Medsphere also offers Revenue Cycle Management (RCM-Cloud), healthcare analytics, supply chain management, and IT outsourcing services, indicating the broader ecosystem stores billing, scheduling, and operational data beyond what any single certified module handles.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "This vendor has six certified products with three distinct export approaches, which is unusual. CareVue uses a native database export to XML files — one per patient — with an XSD schema and a comprehensive 143-table data dictionary derived from the VistA/FileMan database structure. This is the strongest approach and covers the broadest data set. ChartLogic EHR, ChartLogic EHR Classic, and ChartLogic Patient Portal all export C-CDA documents only (with ChartLogic EHR also exporting scanned documents/images as PDFs). Wellsoft EDIS exports as either C-CDA or CSV (but the CSV data dictionary is now a dead link). PCG exports C-CDA only, with bulk export requiring a support request via email. The C-CDA-only products are concerning because C-CDA inherently cannot capture billing line items, insurance authorization details, scheduling data, portal messages, or audit trails. Only CareVue's native XML export has the structural depth to potentially cover all EHI categories.",

CareVue has excellent documentation: a 4.3 MB HTML data dictionary covering 143 VistA-derived database tables with field-level detail including field names, numbers, descriptions, data types, and code sets (e.g., set-of-codes enumerations). It also provides an XSD schema defining the XML export structure. ChartLogic EHR and Classic have minimal documentation — the page simply states they export C-CDA and refers to the HL7 C-CDA specification. There's no product-specific data dictionary showing what C-CDA sections/entries are populated. Wellsoft EDIS mentions a data dictionary for its CSV format but the link (hosted on Pardot/Salesforce via go.chartlogic.com) is dead, making the CSV documentation unavailable. PCG has no data dictionary at all — just a brief description of how to trigger a C-CDA export. A developer working with CareVue data would have rich documentation; a developer working with ChartLogic or PCG data would have essentially nothing beyond the generic C-CDA spec.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "EHI coverage is highly product-dependent and overall incomplete. CareVue's native XML export, backed by 143 VistA-derived database tables, provides the most comprehensive coverage — including clinical data, billing (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AR DEBTOR, AR DATA QUEUE), insurance (MEDICARE ELIGIBLE, MEDICAID ELIGIBLE, PRIVATE INSURANCE ELIGIBLE, POLICY HOLDER, THIRD PARTY LIABILITY, GUARANTOR), appointments (PATIENT APPOINTMENT INFO LOG, VISIT), documents/images (IMAGE, TIU DOCUMENT), and some audit trails (IMAGE AUDIT, COPAY TYPE AUDIT). However, CareVue lacks clear evidence of secure messaging tables. For ChartLogic EHR, ChartLogic EHR Classic, ChartLogic Patient Portal, and PCG — all of which export C-CDA only — coverage is limited to what C-CDA can represent: primarily clinical summary data (diagnoses, medications, allergies, labs, immunizations, vitals, procedures). C-CDA structurally cannot capture billing line items with dollar amounts, insurance authorization details, appointment schedules, portal messages, or audit trails. This is a major gap given that ChartLogic explicitly has practice management (billing, scheduling) and a patient portal ('Connect Patient'). Wellsoft EDIS offers CSV as an alternative to C-CDA, which could potentially contain broader data, but the CSV data dictionary is a dead link — making it impossible to assess what the CSV export actually contains. PCG's bulk export requires contacting vendor support, which raises self-service concerns.",

ChartLogic/Wellsoft/PCG: C-CDA export covers standard clinical data per USCDI v1."
    },
    "secure_messages": {
      "present": false,
      "evidence": "No secure messaging tables found in CareVue's 143-table data dictionary. The only 'message' reference is PTF MESSAGE (a system print message, not patient-provider communication). ChartLogic has a patient portal ('Connect Patient') that almost certainly stores patient-provider messages, but the C-CDA export format cannot represent secure messages. PCG is also a patient portal product but exports only C-CDA. No messaging data appears in any product's export documentation."

    "billing_financial": {
      "present": true,
      "evidence": "CareVue includes AR DEBTOR (file 340 — 'holds information pertaining to debtor accounts: insurance company, patient, person, institution, or vendor'), ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (file 430 — 'permanent record by bill number of the receivable'), AR DATA QUEUE, DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION, and V CPT. However, ChartLogic EHR and Classic — which have their own practice management/billing system — export only C-CDA, which cannot capture billing line items, charges, or payment data. ChartLogic's billing data is entirely absent from its export. Wellsoft and PCG exports also lack billing data."

The PATIENT file also contains eligibility fields. However, these are VA-specific structures and may not map cleanly to commercial insurance workflows.

ChartLogic EHR has a full appointment scheduler ('ChartLogic PM') but its C-CDA export cannot represent scheduling data. Wellsoft tracks patients from pre-admission through disposition but export documentation doesn't address scheduling separately."

    "documents_images": {
      "present": true,
      "evidence": "CareVue includes IMAGE and IMAGE AUDIT tables, MERGE IMAGES, and TIU DOCUMENT (text integration utilities for clinical notes). ChartLogic EHR explicitly states 'documents and images that have been scanned into the system can be exported as PDFs' — this is a notable inclusion beyond C-CDA, though PDF is not machine-readable structured data. Wellsoft has embedded forms capability. ChartLogic Patient Portal and PCG do not mention document/image export."

    "audit_trails": {
      "present": true,

The ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file references audit trail fields. However, these are specialized audit tables rather than a comprehensive 'who accessed what record when' audit log. ChartLogic, Wellsoft, and PCG exports include no audit data."

  "issues": [

    "ChartLogic Patient Portal ('Connect Patient') almost certainly stores patient-provider messages, but the C-CDA export format cannot represent secure messaging data.",
    "Four of six certified products (ChartLogic EHR, ChartLogic EHR Classic, ChartLogic Patient Portal, PCG) use C-CDA as their only export format, which is inadequate for 'all EHI' under b(10) given these products store billing, scheduling, and messaging data.",
    "ChartLogic exports scanned documents as PDFs — while better than omitting them, PDF is not machine-readable structured data.",
    "CareVue's data dictionary is VistA/VA-derived with VA-specific fields (veteran status, service-connected disability, VA benefit categories) that may not be relevant for commercial healthcare settings, raising questions about whether the documentation accurately reflects the product as deployed outside the VA.",
    "No product provides sample export data or example files in the documentation.",
    "The documentation quality is wildly inconsistent across the six products: CareVue has a 4.3 MB data dictionary with 143 tables, while ChartLogic and PCG have essentially no product-specific documentation beyond 'we export C-CDA'."

  "summary": "CareCloud, Inc. manages six certified products under the Medsphere brand with wildly inconsistent EHI export approaches. CareVue (hospital EHR) provides the gold standard: a native XML database export backed by a 143-table VistA-derived data dictionary covering clinical, billing, insurance, and imaging data. However, ChartLogic EHR, ChartLogic Patient Portal, and PCG all export only C-CDA — which is structurally inadequate for 'all EHI' given these products have billing, scheduling, and patient portal capabilities whose data C-CDA cannot represent. Wellsoft EDIS offers CSV as an alternative but its data dictionary link is dead. The critical gap is that ChartLogic's practice management data (billing, scheduling) and patient portal messages are almost certainly not captured in C-CDA exports.",

  "notes": "The corporate structure is complex: CareCloud, Inc. is the developer name on CHPL, the products are marketed under Medsphere (www.medsphere.com), and www.carecloud.com is now a separate entity. The certifications page lists the developer website as www.carecloud.com but the actual documentation lives on medsphere.com. CareVue's VistA heritage gives it an unusually rich database structure for a small/mid-market vendor, but the VA-specific fields (veteran status, service-connected disability) suggest the data dictionary may not perfectly reflect deployments in non-VA settings. The XSD schema dated 2023-09-14 and page last modified 2026-01-09 suggest the documentation is being maintained."
