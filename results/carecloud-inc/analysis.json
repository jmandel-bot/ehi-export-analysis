    "Only CareVue has substantive EHI-specific documentation (XSD schema + 143-file VistA data dictionary)",
    "ChartLogic/PCG C-CDA exports are limited to USCDI v1 data classes — may not constitute 'all EHI' as required by b(10)"
  ],
  "summary": "CareCloud operates 6 certified products under the Medsphere brand with widely varying EHI export documentation quality. CareVue (VistA-based) has excellent documentation: a formal XSD schema and a 4.3 MB data dictionary covering 143 VistA files and 5,553 fields including clinical, billing, insurance, scheduling, imaging, and audit data. The ChartLogic products and PCG offer only C-CDA exports with no vendor-specific data dictionary (just HL7 spec references). Wellsoft claims CSV export capability but its data dictionary link (Pardot-hosted xlsx) is dead. The massive documentation gap between CareVue and the other 5 products is notable — the non-CareVue products effectively just export standard C-CDA documents, which likely doesn't constitute 'all EHI' as required by 170.315(b)(10)."
