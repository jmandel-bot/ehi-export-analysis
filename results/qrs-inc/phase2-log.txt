[RESULT: # QRS, Inc. — Product Research

Researched: 2025-07-14
Developer website: https://qrshs.com/

## Overview

QRS, Inc. ("Quality Rep Services") is a small, privately held medical software company founded in 1983, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee (2010 Castaic Lane, Knoxville, TN 37932). The company was founded by Rusty Dickerson (still President) originally as a manufacturer's representative for cardiac medical equipment — the name "QRS" references the points on a heartbeat wave (ECG). The company transitioned into medical practice management and EHR software.

QRS is a very small vendor serving ambulatory medical practices across the United States. The company emphasizes long-standing customer relationships (testimonials reference 13–15+ year relationships), U.S.-based support, and a "turnkey" approach that bundles software, hardware, networking, data conversion, and ongoing support. They also operate their own claims clearinghouse, clearing "more than two million claims per year." The company does not disclose customer counts or revenue. There is no BBB listing, no G2 or Capterra presence, and very limited third-party coverage — consistent with a very small, niche vendor. Their SSL certificate was expired at time of research (qrshs.com), though the site was functional.

## Product: PARADIGM®

CHPL ID: 15.04.04.2838.PARA.22.01.1.221227 (CHPL listing 11142)

### What It Is

PARADIGM is an integrated EHR and practice management (PM) system for ambulatory medical practices. A critical architectural detail from the vendor's own website: "PARADIGM was designed as a single product with all the benefits of an EHR and Practice Management system. It is not a cobbled together system built from systems that were acquired by purchasing other companies. PARADIGM shares a single database between the EHR and the Practice Management system." This means clinical and billing/administrative data live in one unified database.

The certified module (PARADIGM® version 22) covers both the EHR and PM capabilities. The CHPL certification spans a broad set of criteria: clinical data ((a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(12), (a)(14)), transitions of care ((b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(7), (b)(8), (b)(10), (b)(11)), patient portal/VDT ((e)(1), (e)(3)), clinical quality measures ((c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3)), public health reporting ((f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(5)), and API/FHIR access ((g)(2)–(g)(7), (g)(9), (g)(10)). This is a comprehensive certification covering 39 criteria — indicative of a full-featured ambulatory EHR+PM.

### Users & Market

PARADIGM is marketed to healthcare providers in ambulatory care settings. Per the Real World Testing results: "PARADIGM® EHR is principally marketed to healthcare providers in ambulatory care settings." The vendor's about page says: "Our Software is used by providers across America to streamline their scheduling, charting, imaging, billing, patient engagement, encounter documentation, data security, and more."

Target specialties are broad. The PM page specifically mentions specialty-specific modules for: Radiology, Allergy, Anesthesia Billing, Chiropractic, and Durable Medical Equipment. Customer testimonials come from billing service operators and multi-provider practices. One testimonial references opening a medical billing service and choosing Paradigm for it, suggesting the product is also used by third-party billing companies.

No customer count or install base data is publicly available. The vendor appears to serve primarily small to mid-size medical practices and billing services. The 2025 RWT report mentions testing with "a minimum of three client practices" and notes that "many client practices did not regularly utilize Direct Messaging to share clinical data" — suggesting a relatively small, low-complexity customer base.

### Modules & Functionality

Based on the vendor's website feature descriptions:

### Data & Content

Based on the unified single-database architecture and the features described above, PARADIGM stores:

**Clinical data** (evidenced by EHR features and FHIR API resources):
- Patient demographics (name, DOB, SSN, gender, race, ethnicity, language, address, phone — per FHIR Patient resource)
- Allergies and intolerances (per FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource and EHR features)
- Conditions/problems (per FHIR Condition resource)
- Medications and prescriptions (per FHIR MedicationRequest and EHR prescription module)
- Immunizations (per FHIR Immunization resource)
- Procedures (per FHIR Procedure resource)
- Vital signs and lab results (per FHIR Observation resource)
- Diagnostic reports (per FHIR DiagnosticReport resource)
- Care plans and assessments (per FHIR CarePlan resource)
- Care team members (per FHIR CareTeam resource)
- Goals (per FHIR Goal resource)
- Implantable devices (per FHIR Device resource)
- Encounter records (per FHIR Encounter resource)
- Clinical documents and notes — encounter summary notes (per FHIR DocumentReference and note generation features)
- Scanned documents (TIF, PDF, JPG files stored in patient charts)
- Voice recordings (.wav files attached to encounters)
- Provenance tracking (per FHIR Provenance resource)

**Administrative/billing data** (evidenced by PM features):
- Appointment scheduling data (including patient flow status)
- Insurance information and eligibility verification results
- Claims data (professional and institutional/UB04)
- Claim scrubbing and error information
- Payment, adjustment, and refund records (line-item level)
- Electronic remittance advice
- Insurance contract terms and fee schedules
- Referrals and authorizations
- Collection account data
- Patient statements
- Management reports

**EHI Export format** (from EHI Export Documentation):
- Export is via the "FHIR Data Portability" module, accessible through EHR System Reports
- Output is a ZIP file containing: standard C-CDA R2.1 XML per patient, additional data in JSON format (e.g., "invoice history"), and any files imported into the EHR in their original format (PDF, PNG, etc.) in a `_addt_files` directory
- There is a checkbox to "include all Electronic Healthcare Information (EHI) for each patient in the set"
- The mention of "invoice history" as a JSON export suggests billing/financial data is included in the EHI export

**Notable gaps/uncertainties:**
- The insurance eligibility page references "Practice EHR" in one paragraph, which is a different certified EHR product by a different vendor. This could be a web content error, or could hint at shared technology or white-labeling. However, the PARADIGM product has its own independent CHPL certification and distinct APIs, so this appears to be a copy-paste web error.
- No mention of secure messaging between providers and patients (Direct messaging noted as not widely used by customers in RWT results)
- No explicit mention of patient portal messaging capabilities (though portal exists)
- The vendor does not disclose customer count or market share
- The website's SSL certificate was expired, suggesting limited IT resources for their web presence
- Real World Testing was conducted primarily in sandbox/virtualized environments with small sample sizes (10 requests), not at scale in production — consistent with a very small vendor with limited API adoption

---

## Summary Assessment

PARADIGM is a small-vendor, full-featured ambulatory EHR+PM system with a unified database architecture. Its single-database design means the EHI export scope should encompass both clinical and billing/financial data. The vendor operates their own clearinghouse and provides a vertically integrated suite of services (software, hardware, networking, support, clearinghouse). The product serves small ambulatory practices and billing services, with specialty support for radiology, allergy, anesthesia, chiropractic, and DME billing. Despite its small market presence, the product has comprehensive ONC certification covering 39 criteria.

Good — the product research is very detailed. Key insight: the EHI export is a ZIP file containing C-CDA XML, JSON (invoice history), and original files. Let me now probe the target URL.

Success or failure of API calls are indicated by standard HTTP status codes. In general, status codes in the 2xx range
indicate success and status codes in the 4xx range indicate an error in the request. When an exception is encountered,
along with the status code will be a text response providing further details, such as “Authorization Failure”. The standard
HTTP codes used are listed below.

Good. The FHIR API covers standard US Core resources: Patient, AllergyIntolerance, CarePlan, CareTeam, Condition, Device, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, Goal, Immunization, MedicationRequest, Observation, Procedure, Encounter, Provenance. That's the (g)(10) set.

Now let me verify there's nothing else I'm missing on the site. Let me also check if the Patient API doc is substantively different from the EHI export doc, or if it's essentially the same content.

The Patient API doc and EHI Export doc are nearly identical in their technical content (only the footer differs). Good — no need to deeply analyze the Patient API doc separately.

Now let me get file sizes and write the report.

Of those 6 pages:\n\n- **Pages 1–4**: Terms and Conditions (developer account registration, legal boilerplate, indemnification, etc.) — identical to the terms in the FHIR API and Patient API docs.\n- **Page 5**: \"Export Details and Directory\" and \"Usage\" — the actual EHI export technical documentation.\n- **Pages 5–6**: Patient Search API and Patient C-CDA API endpoint documentation.\n\nThe substantive EHI export documentation amounts to roughly **two paragraphs**:\n\n**Export Format:**\n- Data is exported as a **ZIP file** containing:\n  - **Standard C-CDA R2.1 XML** per patient (e.g., `10000.xml`)\n  - **Additional data in JSON format** (e.g., `10000_invoice history.json`)\n  - **Original imported files** (PDF, PNG, etc.) in a `_addt_files` subdirectory per patient (e.g., `10000_addt_files/`)\n\n**How to trigger the export:**\n- The \"Data Portability module\" is accessible through EHR System Reports by authorized users only.\n- To include all EHI, the user must click a checkbox: \"include all Electronic Healthcare Information (EHI) for each patient in the set.\"\n\n**API endpoints documented:**\n- `GET https://api.qrshs.com/v1/patient/search` — patient lookup by name, DOB, SSN (Basic auth)\n- `GET https://api.qrshs.com/v1/patient/ccda` — retrieve C-CDA XML for a patient (Basic auth), with optional date range filtering\n\nThere is **no data dictionary**, no field-level documentation, no schema definition, no sample export files, and no description of what data fields are included in the C-CDA or the JSON files.\n\n### FHIR API Documentation (27 pages)\n\nThe FHIR API document covers the standard (g)(10) FHIR R4 API. It documents 15 US Core resources:\n\n1. Patient\n2. AllergyIntolerance\n3. CarePlan\n4. CareTeam\n5. Condition\n6. Device\n7. DiagnosticReport\n8. DocumentReference\n9. Goal\n10. Immunization\n11. MedicationRequest\n12. Observation (including vital signs)\n13. Procedure\n14. Encounter\n15. Provenance\n\nThis is the standard US Core / USCDI resource set — it's the (g)(10) API, not a (b)(10) export mechanism. The EHI export documentation references a separate \"FHIR Data Portability module\" that produces ZIP files with C-CDA + JSON, which is architecturally distinct from this FHIR API.\n\n### Patient API Documentation (6 pages)\n\nThe Patient API doc is nearly identical to the EHI Export doc — same terms and conditions, same two API endpoints (`/v1/patient/search` and `/v1/patient/ccda`). It's a companion document describing how to programmatically search for patients and retrieve C-CDA documents.\n\n## Export Coverage Assessment\n\n### Data Domain Coverage\n\nPARADIGM is a unified EHR + Practice Management system with a single database. Based on the product research, it stores:\n\n**Clinical data**: demographics, allergies, conditions/problems, medications/prescriptions, immunizations, procedures, vitals, lab results, diagnostic reports, care plans, care teams, goals, implantable devices, encounters, clinical notes, scanned documents (TIF/PDF/JPG), voice recordings (.wav)\n\n**Administrative/billing data**: scheduling, insurance information, claims (professional + UB04), payment/adjustment/refund records, electronic remittance, insurance contracts/fee schedules, referrals/authorizations, collections, patient statements, eligibility verification results\n\n**What the export documentation tells us:**\n\n- The C-CDA component would cover standard clinical data (demographics, problems, medications, allergies, immunizations, vitals, procedures, results, encounters, notes) — this is the C-CDA CCD standard scope.\n- The mention of `invoice history.json` as an additional JSON file is a **positive signal** — it suggests the export goes beyond clinical data to include billing/financial information. This is one of the few vendors that explicitly mentions financial data in its EHI export.\n- Imported files (PDF, PNG, etc.) in `_addt_files` would capture scanned documents.\n\n**What appears to be missing or undocumented:**\n\n- **Scheduling data** — no mention of appointment history in the export\n- **Insurance information** — no mention beyond the invoice history\n- **Claims detail** — the \"invoice history\" JSON is ambiguous; it's unclear whether it includes full claims data (CPT/ICD codes, payer responses, ERA detail) or just a billing summary\n- **Referrals and authorizations** — not mentioned\n- **Collections data** — not mentioned\n- **Patient statements** — not mentioned\n- **Eligibility verification results** — not mentioned\n- **Insurance contract/fee schedule data** — not mentioned\n- **Voice recordings (.wav files)** — not mentioned (the _addt_files directory only says \"files imported into the EHR\" — it's unclear if system-generated files like voice recordings are included)\n- **Audit logs / provenance** — not mentioned\n- **Specialty-specific data** (radiology, allergy, anesthesia, chiropractic, DME modules) — not mentioned\n\nThe fundamental problem is that the documentation is too sparse to assess. The phrase \"include all Electronic Healthcare Information (EHI) for each patient in the set\" checkbox is encouraging — it implies the system can export more than the default clinical data. But the documentation doesn't describe what \"all EHI\" actually includes.\n\n### Export Format & Standards\n\n- **C-CDA R2.1 XML**: A recognized clinical document standard. Good for clinical data, but inherently limited to the C-CDA document types (CCD, Discharge Summary, etc.). C-CDA does not naturally represent billing, claims, scheduling, or administrative data.\n- **JSON**: Used for additional data like \"invoice history.\" The JSON format is completely undocumented — no schema, no field definitions, no examples. A third party receiving this file would have to reverse-engineer its structure.\n- **Original files**: PDF, PNG, etc. retained in original format. Reasonable approach for scanned documents.\n- **ZIP packaging**: Sensible for bundling multiple file types.\n\nThe format is a pragmatic hybrid: use the standard where it fits (clinical data → C-CDA), use JSON for data that doesn't fit C-CDA (billing), and include original files as-is. This is a better approach than many vendors that try to shoehorn everything into FHIR or C-CDA. However, the JSON component is a black box without documentation.\n\nA third party could parse the C-CDA (it's a standard), but could not reliably interpret the JSON files without the schema, and would have no way to understand the relationships between clinical, billing, and document data.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\nThe documentation is **minimal**. Out of a 6-page PDF, 4 pages are legal terms and conditions. The actual technical content is:\n\n- Two paragraphs describing the export format and directory structure\n- One sentence about triggering the export\n- Two API endpoint specifications (patient search and C-CDA retrieval)\n\nThere is no:\n- Data dictionary\n- Field-level documentation\n- JSON schema or example JSON output\n- Sample C-CDA document\n- Sample export ZIP\n- Description of what data domains are included\n- Mapping between PARADIGM data and export elements\n- Documentation of the \"invoice history\" JSON structure\n- Description of what the \"include all EHI\" checkbox adds vs. the default export\n\nA developer could not implement an import of this data based solely on this documentation. The C-CDA portion would be parseable (it's a standard), but the JSON portion — which is presumably where the non-clinical data lives — is entirely undocumented.\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\n- **Granularity**: No field-level documentation at all. The export format description is at the file/directory level only.\n- **Coded fields**: Not documented.\n- **Relationships**: Not documented.\n- **Value sets**: Not documented.\n- **Versioning**: Document is v1.0, dated September 2023. No change history.\n\nThis documentation reads as a compliance minimum — enough to say \"we have EHI export documentation\" but not enough for anyone to actually understand or consume the export. The contrast between the very brief EHI export doc and the more detailed 27-page FHIR API documentation is telling: significantly more effort went into the (g)(10) API documentation than the (b)(10) export documentation.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nQRS, Inc. has taken a structurally sound approach to EHI export: a ZIP file containing C-CDA for clinical data, JSON for additional data (at minimum billing/invoice history), and original files for imported documents. The \"include all EHI\" checkbox suggests awareness of the (b)(10) distinction from (g)(10). The mention of invoice history as a JSON export is a positive signal — most vendors don't acknowledge billing data in their EHI export at all.\n\nHowever, the documentation is woefully inadequate. The JSON format is completely undocumented, meaning the billing/financial data — arguably the most distinctive part of the export — cannot be interpreted by a third party. There's no data dictionary, no schema, no examples. The documentation is 67% legal boilerplate by page count.\n\nFor a small vendor (~30+ years in business, serving small ambulatory practices), this is consistent with a company that built a functional export mechanism but invested minimal effort in documenting it. The export itself may be more complete than the documentation suggests — the product's unified single-database architecture and the \"all EHI\" checkbox hint at broader coverage — but without documentation, that's speculation.\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL (after redirects): https://www.qrshs.info (no redirects)\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no\n- Navigation complexity: one_click (PDFs linked directly from the disclosure page)\n- Anti-bot issues: none\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\n- None. The site is a simple static HTML page served by nginx with direct PDF links. No JavaScript, no accordions, no authentication required.\n- The `index-5.html` page linked from the navigation returned 404.\n- The site uses HTTP for some internal references (favicon, images) but HTTPS works fine for all document downloads.\n"

Done. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Results

**QRS, Inc. — PARADIGM® EHI Export Documentation**

**Access**: Straightforward. The registered URL (https://www.qrshs.info) is a static HTML "QRS Disclosures" page with direct PDF links. No authentication, no JavaScript, no anti-bot issues.

**Downloaded 3 PDFs + 2 screenshots:**
1. **PARADIGM EHI Export Documentation** (6 pages) — the primary document
2. **PARADIGM FHIR API Documentation** (27 pages) — (g)(10) reference
3. **PARADIGM Patient API Documentation** (6 pages) — companion to EHI doc

**Key findings:**

- **Export format**: ZIP file containing C-CDA XML (clinical data), JSON (additional data like "invoice history"), and original imported files (PDF/PNG/etc.) per patient
- **Positive signal**: The mention of "invoice history" JSON suggests billing data is included — unusual among vendors. An "include all EHI" checkbox suggests awareness of the (b)(10) vs (g)(10) distinction.
- **Major gap**: The documentation is **extremely sparse** — only ~2 paragraphs of actual technical content out of a 6-page PDF (the rest is legal T&C). There is **no data dictionary, no JSON schema, no sample exports, no field-level documentation**. The JSON files (where the non-clinical data lives) are completely undocumented.
- **Assessment**: The export mechanism itself may be more comprehensive than most vendors' efforts, but the documentation makes it impossible for a third party to verify this or consume the export reliably.
