[RESULT: # Varian Medical Systems — Product Research

Researched: 2025-07-14

## Overview

Varian Medical Systems is a major oncology technology company, now a subsidiary of Siemens Healthineers (acquired in 2021 for ~$16.4 billion). Varian is the global leader in radiation therapy equipment and software, with a dominant market share in linear accelerators (linacs) and oncology information systems. Their products are used in radiation oncology, medical oncology, and surgical oncology departments across thousands of cancer centers worldwide — from community hospitals to major academic medical centers.

Varian's software portfolio centers on the ARIA platform, which is an Oncology Information System (OIS) / oncology-specific EHR. ARIA manages the clinical, administrative, and financial workflows of cancer treatment departments. The newer "ARIA CORE" is the evolution of the legacy "ARIA OIS" platform, designed to unify radiation oncology, medical oncology, and systemic therapy management into a single system. Noona is a separate patient engagement/patient-reported outcomes (PRO) platform that Varian acquired (originally developed by Finnish company Noona Healthcare) and integrated into the ARIA ecosystem.

## Product: ARIA CORE

CHPL IDs: 11719

### What It Is

ARIA CORE is Varian's next-generation oncology information system (OIS) — essentially a specialty EHR purpose-built for cancer care. It evolved from the legacy ARIA OIS platform and is designed to be a comprehensive clinical, administrative, and workflow management system for radiation oncology, medical oncology, and surgical oncology departments. The product name "ARIA CORE" represents the unified platform; it has additional modules including ARIA CORE Mobile (mobile access), ARIA Systemic Therapy Management (cloud-native chemotherapy/immunotherapy module), and connects to ARIA CORE Insights (analytics) and Noona (patient engagement).

ARIA CORE is certified for a broad range of ONC criteria: clinical data (a)(1)-(5), (a)(12), (a)(14); transitions of care (b)(1)-(3); patient portal (e)(1); FHIR APIs (g)(7), (g)(9), (g)(10); and public health (h)(1). This indicates it functions as a full clinical EHR within its oncology domain — not just a treatment planning tool.

### Users & Market

**Users**: Radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation therapists, oncology nurses, nurse practitioners, medical physicists, dosimetrists, clinic schedulers, billing staff, practice managers. The SED description lists "Registered nurses, nurse practitioners, therapist, medical doctors."

**Settings**: Hospital-based cancer centers, freestanding radiation oncology clinics, academic medical centers, community oncology practices, proton therapy centers. Varian linacs are installed in thousands of facilities worldwide; ARIA is the standard OIS paired with Varian treatment machines.

**Market position**: Varian is the dominant player in radiation oncology technology globally. Their linacs (TrueBeam, Halcyon, Edge) and OIS (ARIA) together form the standard workflow in most radiation oncology departments. The ARIA install base is estimated at 5,000+ sites worldwide. As a Siemens Healthineers company, they have massive enterprise sales reach.

**Notable**: ARIA is typically deployed alongside Varian treatment delivery hardware. It's often the "system of record" for the radiation oncology department even when the hospital uses a general-purpose EHR (like Epic or Cerner) for the rest of the organization. ARIA integrates with those systems via HL7 and DICOM interfaces. The product page specifically mentions an "ARIA Epic Product Brief" and interoperability features.

### Data It Likely Stores

ARIA CORE stores an exceptionally deep dataset specific to oncology care:

**Clinical Records (Core)**:
- Patient demographics
- Diagnoses (ICD-9, ICD-10, ICD-O oncology codes)
- Cancer staging (automated AJCC staging)
- Medications and drug orders
- Lab results and vital signs
- Allergies
- Clinical notes and assessments
- Problem lists
- Performance status scores (ECOG, Karnofsky, GOG, Lansky)

**Radiation Therapy-Specific Data**:
- Treatment plans (prescriptions, dose calculations, field configurations)
- Treatment delivery records (actual delivered doses per fraction)
- Treatment schedules and fractionation schemes
- Machine parameters and delivery data
- Image-guided therapy images (MV, kV, CBCT, CT, MR, PET)
- Quality assurance records and chart audits
- Treatment overrides and modification history
- Physics QA data
- Dose-volume histograms
- Plan approval chains with e-signatures

**Medical Oncology-Specific Data**:
- Chemotherapy regimens (300+ disease-specific protocols)
- Dose calculations (m², /kg, AUC-based)
- Drug interaction checks and dose limits
- Treatment modification rules
- Toxicity management and adverse event documentation
- Chemotherapy administration records
- Pharmacy orders

**Clinical Trials**:
- Protocol management
- Patient screening and enrollment
- Scheduling
- Case Report Form auto-generation
- Trial-specific documentation

**Scheduling**:
- Patient appointments
- Resource/machine scheduling
- Staff scheduling
- Recurring appointment management
- Outlook synchronization

**Billing/Financial**:
- Charge capture (automatic for completed activities)
- HCPCS, CPT, and custom billing codes
- ICD code verification for reimbursement
- Technical/professional charge splitting
- RVU tracking
- Productivity analysis
- Export to billing systems

Only clean business is Siemens Healthineers business! Siemens Healthineers stands for innovation and the quality of our products and solutions for our customers. At the same time, we want to be a company that wins against competitors through fair play and compliance with the law. Compliance and integrity in all our activities are part of our DNA at Siemens Healthineers. Bernd Montag, CEO, Siemens Healthineers Our Compliance System Our Legal &amp; Compliance organization is directly accountable to the CEO of Siemens Healthineers AG, and reports to the Managing Board as well as to the Supervisory Board on a regular basis. What does Compliance stand for at Siemens Healthineers? We do not tolerate any kind of bribery, any violation of competition and antitrust laws, nor any violation of data privacy rights. At the same time, we work to ensure that third parties will not misuse our business for money laundering. Together with our partners worldwide we foster transparency and fairness within the healthcare industry in Collective Action projects. We adhere to export control and customs regulations and respect human rights. What are the components of the Compliance System at Siemens Healthineers? Our Compliance System is composed of three operating levels: Prevent, Detect, and Respond. We focus on preventive measures like information, training, and clear regulations which are valid for everybody. Essential business transactions are reviewed thoroughly with regard to Compliance risks, prior to execution. Should there still be violations of applicable law, we will investigate the circumstances comprehensively in a fair procedure and then take appropriate disciplinary measures, as deemed necessary. The basic principle behind your reaction to each identified violation is: Every employee and manager is treated equally and recognized weak spots in the system will be remediated. Our global Compliance team helps to ensure that all employees of Siemens Healthineers act with integrity and in compliance with the law. If you observe any behavior which violates applicable law or principles of integrity, please report this. Benedikt Knothe, Chief Compliance Officer, Siemens Healthineers Channels for Reporting Misconduct The heart and soul of our Compliance System are the Business Conduct Guidelines, which establish the binding rules of conduct for all employees towards each other as well as towards the integrity of our business. &nbsp;All Healthineers, whether employee or manager, have to understand Compliance as part of their own tasks; with management bearing the responsibility for the correct conduct of the team members. The same standards that we adhere to are also valid for our business partners in sales, procurement, and production Any violations of these standards can be reported via our whistleblower tool Let Us Know or our ombudswoman Collective Action We fight corruption collectively, working together with various interest groups to build an alliance against corruption. We approach and resolve the problem from multiple angles with the ultimate goal of creating fair and equal market conditions – a "level playing field" – for all market players and eliminating the temptations of corruption for all. Collective Action at Siemens Healthineers aims to bring more opportunities to cooperate with alliances in the healthcare industry, to improve the compliance environment, and to benefit all – not only market players, but also healthcare professionals and patients. We do this for example by being a member of the trade association MedTech Europe and actively working on the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice Siemens Healthineers Business Conduct Guidelines The Business Conduct Guidelines set the ethical and legal framework, within which we intend to act and stay successful. They contain the basic principles and rules for the conduct of all employees and managers within the company as well as in relation to our external partners and the general public. The Business Conduct Guidelines will adapt to new legal regulations and are aligned with international treaties regarding human rights, the fight against corruption, as well as sustainability. All employees are called upon to adhere to the Siemens Healthineers Business Conduct Guidelines and to live them actively. Business Conduct Guidelines (pdf) 53.19 MB Siemens Healthineers Policy Statement&nbsp; As part of its implementation of human rights and environmental due diligence, Siemens Healthineers is subject to the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG). Our policy statement sets out the company's strategy for protecting human rights and fulfilling its environmental obligations. Siemens Healthineers Policy statement (pdf) 0.21 MB LkSG Report In its annual report to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA) Siemens Healthineers describes the fulfilment of its due diligence obligations in the previous financial year.&nbsp; The reports are only available in German.

We also cooperate with other kind of partners like consultants, or partners in joint ventures or consortia. Our aim is to make sure that all our partners work with a high level of transparency and integrity comparable to ours. Therefore we carefully select our partners and achieve transparency through a due diligence check followed by continuous training and monitoring. Our company-wide established internal Business Partner Tool helps ensure that all processes are implemented and lived without exception. Code of Conduct for suppliers of Siemens Healthineers We want to be an integral part of the national society and economy in all countries. In daily business this represents a challenge due to the varying regulatory environments we operate in. That is why we developed a Code of Conduct for our suppliers. In essence, the Code of Conduct for suppliers to Siemens Healthineers is based on the UN Global Compact and the principles of the International Labor Organization and is also reflected in our Business Conduct Guidelines, which are binding for all employees of Siemens Healthineers. The topics of the Code of Conduct are: Compliance with the laws of the applicable legal system Prohibition of corruption and bribery Fair competition, anti-trust laws, and intellectual property rights Avoidance of conflicts of interest Respect for the basic human rights of employees Prohibition of child labor Health and safety of employees Environmental protection Promotion of the Code of Conduct among further suppliers in the supply chain and no discrimination in supplier selection and treatment Responsible minerals sourcing Channels for reporting misconduct Reliable reporting channels for internal and external stakeholders and the protection of internal whistle-blowers from sanctions help ensure that possible misconduct is reported, thoroughly investigated, and clarified. We provide several reporting channels to internal and external whistle-blowers to inform us about possible compliance violations. Let Us Know reporting system Let Us Know provides a secure channel for reporting non-compliant or otherwise problematic actions 24 hours a day: online, anonymously if desired, and in several languages. We protect the identity of whistleblowers and follow-up on these reports. The Siemens Healthineers Ombudswoman In addition, attorney-at-law Dr. Sibylle von Coelln &nbsp;from the Duesseldorf-based law firm HEUKING·VON COELLN, has been appointed as our external ombudswoman.

I've thoroughly searched the entire Varian/Siemens Healthineers Cancer Care website and the broader Siemens Healthineers site. The registered URL `https://varian.com/aria/ehi` redirects to `https://cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/aria/ehi` which returns a 404. There is no EHI export documentation publicly available anywhere on the site.

Let me take one more screenshot of the 404 page for documentation, then write the collection log.

The 404 page says:\n> \"Even a Klystron isn't going to help you find the page for which you were looking.\"\n\nWith alternate recommendations linking to Home and Search.\n\n### Step 3: Checking Wayback Machine\n```bash\ncurl -s \"http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=varian.com/aria/ehi*&output=text&limit=20\"\ncurl -s \"http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/aria/ehi*&output=text&limit=20\"\ncurl -s \"http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=varian.com/*ehi*&output=text&limit=30\"\ncurl -s \"http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/*ehi*&output=text&limit=30\"\n```\nAll queries returned **zero results**. The Wayback Machine has never captured this URL or any EHI-related URL on either domain. This suggests the page may never have been publicly available, or was created very recently and taken down before any archival.\n\n### Step 4: Probing alternative paths on cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com\nTested multiple alternative paths:\n```\n404 /aria/ehi\n404 /ehi\n404 /ehi-export\n200 /interoperability  (but redirects to /products/interoperability - hardware interop, no EHI content)\n404 /compliance\n404 /legal\n404 /onc\n404 /b10\n200 /aria  (product page - no EHI content)\n200 /products/software  (software listing - no EHI content)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Examining the /products/interoperability page\nNavigated to `https://cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/products/interoperability` in browser. Content is about hardware interoperability — Patient Motion Management (MMI interface), Practice Management (ARIA API for third-party integrations), Treatment Delivery (VTI interface), and industry standards (IHE, DICOM). **No mention of EHI export, ONC certification, b(10), or electronic health information export.**\n\n### Step 6: Examining the ARIA CORE product page\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/products/software/digital-oncology/oncology-management-systems/aria-core\" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0'\n```\nGrepped for EHI/export/certification keywords. Only mentions \"Interoperability\" in passing. No links to EHI export documentation.\n\n### Step 7: Checking Legal Information and Government Affairs pages\n- `/about-us/legal-information` — Contains sub-pages for EU REACH, Intended Use, Copyright, Trademarks, Patents, etc. No EHI content.\n- `/about-us/government-affairs` — About government lobbying and reimbursement/Medicare policy. No EHI or ONC certification content.\n\n### Step 8: Checking the Siemens Healthineers compliance page\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/company/compliance\" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0'\n```\nThis is about anti-corruption, business conduct guidelines, supply chain due diligence. No health IT certification or EHI content.\n\n### Step 9: Sitemap analysis\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/sitemap.xml\"\n```\nThe sitemap contains only 13 URLs — all just locale variants of the homepage. The sitemap does not index any inner pages, making it impossible to discover content through this mechanism.\n\n### Step 10: Site search\nAttempted the site's built-in search at `/search?keys=EHI+export`. The search is a Drupal JS-driven widget that requires client-side interaction. The search page loads at `/node/390` but returns \"Start typing to search\" with no results pre-populated.\n\n### Step 11: Checking subdomains\n- `d8-prod.varian.com` — Returns 401 (password-protected staging/production Drupal site)\n- `go.varian.com` — Marketing automation domain; redirects all paths to the homepage\n- `www.myvarian.com` — Customer portal requiring login (Salesforce-based); returns 302 to login page\n- `webapps.varian.com` — Certificate manager, requires login\n\n### Step 12: Web search\n- DuckDuckGo: `site:varian.com \"EHI export\" ARIA` — No results\n- DuckDuckGo: `varian ARIA \"electronic health information\" export \"b(10)\"` — No results\n- DuckDuckGo: `site:cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com EHI` — No EHI-related results (only homepage, login page, customer services, Eclipse)\n- DuckDuckGo: `varian \"EHI export\" ARIA \"data dictionary\"` — Results are all for other vendors (Aarista, Flatiron, Sightview), not Varian\n- Bing: `\"varian.com/aria/ehi\"` — No relevant results; only generic Varian pages\n- Google: Blocked by CAPTCHA\n\n### Step 13: Checking siemens-healthineers.com paths\n```\n404 https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/ehi\n404 https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/aria/ehi\n404 https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/products/aria/ehi\n404 https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/ehi-export\n```\n\n### Step 14: Checking cybersecurity and resources pages\n- `/resources-support/cybersecurity-at-varian` — No EHI, export, or certification content\n- `/resources-support` — No downloadable PDFs or documents related to EHI export\n\n## Downloads\n\nNo EHI export documentation files were found.\n\n### 404-page-screenshot.png (294 KB)\nScreenshot of the 404 page at the registered URL.\nSaved to: downloads/404-page-screenshot.png\nContent: Browser screenshot showing \"Page not found\" error at https://cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/aria/ehi\n\n## Access Summary\n- Registered URL: https://varian.com/aria/ehi\n- Final URL (after redirect): https://cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/aria/ehi\n- Status: **dead** (404 after redirect)\n- Required browser: No (curl confirmed 404)\n- Navigation complexity: N/A — page does not exist\n- Anti-bot issues: TrustArc cookie consent banner on all pages (cosmetic only, does not block content)\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\n\n### The URL has never existed\nThe registered CHPL URL `https://varian.com/aria/ehi` returns 404. More significantly:\n- The Wayback Machine has **zero captures** of this URL or any EHI-related URL on varian.com or cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com\n- No web search engine has indexed any EHI export documentation from Varian\n- The cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com sitemap indexes only the homepage (13 locale variants)\n- The `d8-prod.varian.com` staging server is password-protected (401)\n\nThis strongly suggests the EHI export documentation page was **never created** or was created and immediately taken down before any archival. The URL may have been registered with CHPL in anticipation of creating the page.\n\n### Domain transition complicates discovery\nVarian was acquired by Siemens Healthineers, and the varian.com domain now redirects to cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com. The path `/aria/ehi` was presumably planned for the new domain but was never set up.\n\n### Customer portal may contain documentation\nThe MyVarian portal (www.myvarian.com) is a Salesforce-based customer portal requiring login. It's possible that EHI export documentation exists behind this login wall, but this would violate the ONC requirement that EHI export documentation be publicly accessible. This is a significant compliance concern.\n\n### Certification dates\n- ARIA CORE (CHPL 11719): Certified 2025-11-26 — CHPL product number `15.04.04.2496.ARIA.18.08.1.251126`\n- Noona (CHPL 11747): Certified 2026-01-01 — CHPL product number `15.04.04.2496.Noon.10.05.0.260101`\n\nBoth certifications are very recent. The documentation may not yet have been published at the registered URL.\n\n## Conclusion\n**No EHI export documentation was found.** The registered URL returns 404, no alternative locations were discovered on any Varian or Siemens Healthineers domain, and no cached/archived version exists. This represents a compliance gap — certified EHR products are required to make their EHI export documentation publicly accessible at the URL registered with CHPL.\n"

## Summary

The registered EHI export documentation URL for Varian Medical Systems is **dead (404)**. Here's what I found:

**URL chain:** `https://varian.com/aria/ehi` → 301 → `https://cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/aria/ehi` → **404**

**Investigation findings:**
- The Wayback Machine has **zero captures** — this URL has likely never had content
- No EHI export documentation exists anywhere on the Varian or Siemens Healthineers Cancer Care websites
- The site's sitemap only indexes 13 homepage locale variants
- Web searches (DuckDuckGo, Bing) return no Varian-specific EHI results
- The `d8-prod.varian.com` staging server is password-protected (401)
- The MyVarian customer portal requires login (possible compliance violation)

**Likely explanation:** Both products were very recently certified — ARIA CORE on 2025-11-26 and Noona on 2026-01-01. The URL was probably registered with CHPL but the documentation page was never actually created, or was created and removed during the varian.com → cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com domain migration.

**Files written:**
- `collection-log.md` — Full navigation journal with all 14 investigation steps
- `download-manifest.json` — Manifest recording the dead status with zero files
- `downloads/404-page-screenshot.png` — Screenshot of the 404 page
