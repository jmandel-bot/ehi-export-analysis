Also has built-in charge capture, billing code management, and practice management integration. Certified for FHIR APIs (g)(7), (g)(9), (g)(10) and patient portal (e)(1)."

  "notes": "Varian Medical Systems was acquired by Siemens Healthineers in April 2021 for ~$16.4B. Varian is the global leader in radiation oncology technology (linear accelerators + oncology software). ARIA is typically deployed in hospital cancer centers alongside Varian treatment machines and integrates with the hospital's main EHR via HL7/DICOM. The ARIA CORE platform is the evolution of the legacy ARIA OIS, with cloud-native modules (STM, Insights) being added. The certified products (ARIA CORE and Noona) are part of a broader 'Digital Oncology' ecosystem that also includes Eclipse treatment planning, ARIA CORE Mobile, ARIA CORE Insights analytics, and ARIA Systemic Therapy Management."
