  "notes": "Registered URL redirects from varian.com to cancercare.siemens-healthineers.com/aria/ehi which returns 404. The Wayback Machine has zero captures of this URL. No EHI export documentation was found anywhere on the Varian or Siemens Healthineers Cancer Care websites. Exhaustive search of alternative paths, sitemap, site search, web search engines, subdomains, and related pages yielded no results. Varian was acquired by Siemens Healthineers and the domain migration may have caused the page to be lost, or the page may never have been created. Both ARIA CORE (certified 2025-11-26) and Noona (certified 2026-01-01) are very recently certified; documentation may not yet have been published. The MyVarian customer portal (www.myvarian.com) requires login and may contain documentation behind a login wall, which would violate ONC public accessibility requirements."
