**Patient demographics** including custom demographic fields\n- **Clinical notes** with structured field types and values, plus templates\n- **Problems/diagnoses**, **medications**, **allergies** — the core clinical lists\n- **Procedures** performed\n- **Lab orders, results, documents**, and laboratory vendor information\n- **Immunization/vaccine records** and vaccine inventory\n- **Prescriptions** and pharmacy communications\n- **Care plans**, **risk assessments**, **physical exams**, **interventions**\n- **Implantable device** records\n- **Amendments** to clinical records\n- **Appointments** with profiles, templates, and custom fields\n- **Billing data**: billing profiles, fee schedules, line items, transactions, patient payments, payment logs\n- **Insurance information**: carriers, plan names, eligibility checks\n- **Consent forms**\n- **Messages**: internal (staff-to-staff), patient messages, prescription messages, communication logs\n- **Documents**: faxed documents, uploaded documents, referral documents\n- **Tasks** with categories, notes, statuses, and templates\n- **Office/location** configurations including exam rooms\n- **User/provider** accounts and permission groups\n- **C-CDA documents** (clinical summaries for care transitions)\n- **Patient portal access** records\n- **Yellow notepad** (quick/sticky notes)\n- **Patient flags** (alert categories)\n- **Reminder profiles** (appointment reminder configurations)\n- **Custom vitals** configurations\n\nThe vendor's feature page and reviews confirm the platform handles integrated billing with claims submission and denial management, which means it stores claims data, ERA/EOB data, and denial records. The API explicitly exposes line items, transactions, and payment logs.\n\nThe OnPatient patient portal stores patient-submitted intake forms, consent forms, secure messages, and payment information.\n\nOne area that is referenced but less clearly documented is **document management** — faxed documents and uploaded files are mentioned in support articles as faxable from the EHR, but the API doesn't have a clearly labeled \"documents\" endpoint for general uploaded files (though lab_documents, consent_forms, and amendments are present). The fax functionality appears built-in and would store fax records.\n","numLines":174,"startLine":1,"totalLines":174}}}

Users who have the EHI Export permission enabled in DrChrono will be able to select the data they wish to export. Once the request is processed, you will be able to download your ZIP file(s) from within the EHI Dashboard. What are the benefits of this functionality? 1. Users can perform an electronic health information (EHI) export at any time without creating a support ticket for assistance. The export file(s): &nbsp;is created in a timely fashion.\n\n\n=== /tmp/drchrono-creating-request.html (660686 bytes) ===\nEHI Export: Overview You can create two types of export requests: Individual and Bulk. An individual export allows you to export the data associated with a patient. A practice export will export all the patient and document data in your account. Exports are available for download for 30 days once completed. After 30 days (from the date a request has finished processing and is available for download), the request will move to the Archived tab. You will still be able to view the details of the request once it is archived, but the downloadable files will be permanently deleted and no longer available. How to enable the EHI Export permission? Account &gt; Staff Permissions &gt; Provider / Staff tab &gt; View &gt; Edit Permission , then choose the applicable permission(s) &gt; Save. Single Patient EHI Export Bulk Patient EHI Expor t Where is the functionality located? Both types of exports begin under the Reports menu &rarr; EHI Data Export and within the reports screen (left column). Next, from the EHI Export dashboard, select New Export Request . How to submit an export request? Exported documents are appended to include an ID number or similar identifier to distinguish the file from others that could have the same file name.\n\n\n=== /tmp/drchrono-ref-guide-v1.html (679235 bytes) ===\nEHI Export: Overview Introduction This Reference Guide outlines the ability for DrChrono EHR clients to perform an electronic health information (EHI) export as described in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) &sect; 170.315(b)(10)(i)(A) for a single patient, and as described in CFR &sect; 170.315(b)(10)(ii) for a patient population. The data export computable format utilized is a Comma Separated Values file (.csv) and includes this publicly accessible hyperlink to access the DrChrono EHI export.csv schema. It should be noted that this documentation reflects the broader product data availability while data for specific organizations may differ based on the practice use case and subscription to optional services available to DrChrono clients. Additionally, the potential for custom development or other ancillary data elements not generally available to DrChrono clients may impact the exported data for some clients. The data element headers provide common industry categorization of data files for ease of use. Each data element outlined will contain the following data components to assist third party vendors with mapping the EHI exported data to their respective systems: the EHI Data File Name, Data Fields within the file and Data field descriptions where necessary. These files contain valuable data in .csv format, and this documentation will help technical teams understand the structure, naming conventions, and other essential details for consuming the data provided. File Naming Convention for Exported Data All data export files follow a consistent naming convention: Prefix : Filename that relates to data type being exported Extension : .csv Example : `allergy.csv` Data Export File Processing Time, and Delivery Options The processing time and delivery options will vary depending on the type of export being requested. Single patient exports are produced by authorized system users via the DrChrono EHR user interface and are processed in real time.

The drchrono_data_export folder is the product of the data export. It defines a structured approach for exporting data into a hierarchical folder directory. Each exported item is organized into specific folders and subfolders, with a focus on maintainability and easy access. Here&#39;s a breakdown of the likely structure of the exported directory and its files: Base Folder Note : For practice level EHI Exports, DrChrono exports 50 patients at a time.

Practices should plan to allow up to 14 business days to obtain your EHI Export from DrChrono EHR. Time varies based on the number of exports running and the practice EHI Export size. How large will my practice EHI Export be? Export size depends on the practice size and duration on DrChrono EHR. We&#39;ve seen exports from larger practices in upwards of 200+GB. What file types are exported? The export will be a .zip file containing CSV files for the practice. You can learn more about the EHI Export contents here . What are the technical requirements to download a practice EHI Export? If your practice is a larger, tenured DrChrono customer, you will need to ensure your computer has enough disk space to download a large (up-to several hundred gigabyte) file. You will also need a strong internet connection and bandwidth to download a large .ZIP file as well as a strong processor to extract the CSV files from the .ZIP file. If you are unable to meet these technical requirements to begin the download on your own, you have the option of working with our ETL team to obtain your practice EHI Export on a hard-drive for an additional cost. Why is my export CSV file blank?&nbsp; CSV files that show up blank for a single patient or practice EHI Export are blank because there is no data. Blank CSV files will still contain a header. Multiple blank CSV files for the same CSV file types (e.g. allergies)&nbsp; may exist because the CSV files are produced for groups of data/patients.&nbsp; Why am I receiving multiple CSV files? &nbsp; For practice level EHI Exports, DrChrono exports 50 patients at a time. As a result, you will receive a set of CSV files per each 50 patients. The CSV files will display numerically with # (e.g. additional_responsible_party_1).

Users who have the EHI Export permission enabled in DrChrono will be able to select the data they wish to export. Once the request is processed, you will be able to download your ZIP file(s) from within the EHI Dashboard. What are the benefits of this functionality? 1. Users can perform an electronic health information (EHI) export at any time without creating a support ticket for assistance.

An individual export allows you to export the data associated with a patient. A practice export will export all the patient and document data in your account. Exports are available for download for 30 days once completed. After 30 days (from the date a request has finished processing and is available for download), the request will move to the Archived tab. You will still be able to view the details of the request once it is archived, but the downloadable files will be permanently deleted and no longer available. How to enable the EHI Export permission? Account &gt; Staff Permissions &gt; Provider / Staff tab &gt; View &gt; Edit Permission , then choose the applicable permission(s) &gt; Save. Single Patient EHI Export Bulk Patient EHI Expor t Where is the functionality located? Both types of exports begin under the Reports menu &rarr; EHI Data Export and within the reports screen (left column). Next, from the EHI Export dashboard, select New Export Request . How to submit an export request? Exported documents are appended to include an ID number or similar identifier to distinguish the file from others that could have the same file name.\n\n\n=== /tmp/drchrono-ref-guide-v1.html (679235 bytes) ===\nEHI Export: Overview Introduction This Reference Guide outlines the ability for DrChrono EHR clients to perform an electronic health information (EHI) export as described in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) &sect; 170.315(b)(10)(i)(A) for a single patient, and as described in CFR &sect; 170.315(b)(10)(ii) for a patient population. The data export computable format utilized is a Comma Separated Values file (.csv) and includes this publicly accessible hyperlink to access the DrChrono EHI export.csv schema. It should be noted that this documentation reflects the broader product data availability while data for specific organizations may differ based on the practice use case and subscription to optional services available to DrChrono clients. Additionally, the potential for custom development or other ancillary data elements not generally available to DrChrono clients may impact the exported data for some clients. The data element headers provide common industry categorization of data files for ease of use. Each data element outlined will contain the following data components to assist third party vendors with mapping the EHI exported data to their respective systems: the EHI Data File Name, Data Fields within the file and Data field descriptions where necessary. These files contain valuable data in .csv format, and this documentation will help technical teams understand the structure, naming conventions, and other essential details for consuming the data provided. File Naming Convention for Exported Data All data export files follow a consistent naming convention: Prefix : Filename that relates to data type being exported Extension : .csv Example : `allergy.csv` Data Export File Processing Time, and Delivery Options The processing time and delivery options will vary depending on the type of export being requested. Single patient exports are produced by authorized system users via the DrChrono EHR user interface and are processed in real time.

Accessing the Index File and Data Mappings To begin, you will need to access the index file. The index files provide the essential mappings for each data element in the export files and will be key to linking various pieces of patient and document information.&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn more about downloading EHI Export Files . File Organization Overview For an overview of how the files are organized, including where to find specific data for individual patients and bulk exports, please refer to&nbsp; DrChrono EHI Export Reference Guide v1 . This reference guide outlines the folder structure and shows where data types are stored, including patient demographics, clinical notes, consent forms, and other documents. Mapping Patient Data Across Files This section explains how to trace and map patient data across the different files in your export. We will be using the uploaded_documents.csv&nbsp; file as an example. Step 1: Locate the Demographics File One of the key files in your export is the demographics.csv file, which contains patient demographic information. In this file, the ID field corresponds to the unique patient ID in the DrChrono system. See the example below. Demographics.csv:&nbsp; The id field contains the unique patient ID (e.g., 12345). Step 2: Locate the Uploaded Documents File Next, look at the uploaded_documents.csv file, which contains data related to patient documents. In this file: The id field is the unique document ID. The patient_id field links the document to a specific patient, matching the patient ID in the demographics.csv file. See the example below. Uploaded_documents.csv: The patient_id field will match the id field from the demographics.csv file, allowing you to track which documents belong \n\n=== Data Mapping v2 ===\nRelevant to exports completed AFTER 2/19/2025 This guide is designed to help you understand how to map the data in the DrChrono Electronic Health Information (EHI) exports, and it covers how to trace patient data, media files, and document associations across different export files. The EHI practice level (bulk) export contains a number of folders and files associated with the patients and doctors within a practice group. The export is downloaded locally as a .zip file. Once opened, the following folders are made available: Doctors - This folder contains various .csv files that are relevant to the providers within a practice group. This folder will not contain any actual media files; those are located in the Media folder.&nbsp; Media - This folder contains the actual media files that are associated with the various .csv files within the export. This folder may contain .pdf files, .jpg files, etc.&nbsp; Patients - This folder contains various .csv files that are relevant to the patients within a practice group. This folder will not contain any actual media files.&nbsp; Practice Group - This folder (practice_group) contains .csv files that are relevant to the practice group as a whole. This folder will not contain any actual media files.&nbsp; 1. Accessing the Index File and Data Mappings To begin, you&#39;ll need to access the index file.

Step 1: Locate the Demographics File One of the key files in your export is the demographics.csv file, which contains patient demographic information. In this file, the ID field corresponds to the unique patient ID in the DrChrono system. See the example below. Demographics.csv:&nbsp; The id field contains the unique patient ID (e.g., 12345). Step 2: Locate the Uploaded Documents File Next, look at the uploaded_documents.csv file, which contains data related to patient documents. In this file: The id field is the unique document ID. The patient_id field links the document to a specific patient, matching the patient ID in the demographics.csv file. See the example below. Uploaded_documents.csv: The patient_id field will match the id field from the demographics.csv file, allowing you to track which documents belong \n\n=== Data Mapping v2 ===\nRelevant to exports completed AFTER 2/19/2025 This guide is designed to help you understand how to map the data in the DrChrono Electronic Health Information (EHI) exports, and it covers how to trace patient data, media files, and document associations across different export files. The EHI practice level (bulk) export contains a number of folders and files associated with the patients and doctors within a practice group. The export is downloaded locally as a .zip file. Once opened, the following folders are made available: Doctors - This folder contains various .csv files that are relevant to the providers within a practice group. This folder will not contain any actual media files; those are located in the Media folder.&nbsp; Media - This folder contains the actual media files that are associated with the various .csv files within the export. This folder may contain .pdf files, .jpg files, etc.&nbsp; Patients - This folder contains various .csv files that are relevant to the patients within a practice group. This folder will not contain any actual media files.&nbsp; Practice Group - This folder (practice_group) contains .csv files that are relevant to the practice group as a whole. This folder will not contain any actual media files.&nbsp; 1. Accessing the Index File and Data Mappings To begin, you&#39;ll need to access the index file. The index files provide the essential mappings for each data element in the export files and will be key to linking various pieces of patient and document information. You can learn more about downloading EHI Export Files using the link below:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Download the index file for EHI exports 2. File Organization Overview For an overview of how the files are organized, including where to find specific data for individual patients and bulk exports, please refer to the following guide: DrChrono EHI Export Reference Guide This ref\n\n=== Media Mapping === NO ARTICLE BODY\nArticle Not Found | DrChrono by EverHealth .hg-minimalist-theme.hg-2column-layout .slideout-menu{background-color:#F8F4F1}.hg-site .hg-header{background-color:#e7f0ff}.hg-widget-page .pager{background-color:#e7f0ff}.hg-minimalist-theme .level-0 > .category-link-container:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .level-0 > .category-link-container.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container .article-link:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container .article-link.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-categories .level-0 > .category-link-container a:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-categories li.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .category-link-container.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-categories .article-container:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-categorie\n\n=== Single/Bulk Exports === NO ARTICLE BODY\nSingle Patient and Bulk Exports | DrChrono by EverHealth .hg-minimalist-theme.hg-2column-layout .slideout-menu{background-color:#F8F4F1}.hg-site .hg-header{background-color:#e7f0ff}.hg-widget-page .pager{background-color:#e7f0ff}.hg-minimalist-theme .level-0 > .category-link-container:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .level-0 > .category-link-container.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container .article-link:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-outter-list > .article-container .article-link.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-categories .level-0 > .category-link-container a:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-categories li.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .category-link-container.active, .hg-minimalist-theme .documentation-categories .article-container:hover, .hg-minimalist-theme .documenta","stderr":"","interrupted":false,"isImage":false}}

No redirects. The page is a KnowledgeOwl-hosted support article.\n\n### Step 2: Fetched and examined the overview page\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://support.drchrono.com/home/20260096536987-ehi-export-overview\" \\\n  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o ehi-export-overview.html\n```\nThe overview page describes the EHI Export product — a self-service export feature compliant with 21st Century Cures Act. It links to a rich set of sub-pages.\n\n### Step 3: Identified documentation link structure\nSearched the HTML for EHI-related links and found an extensive documentation hub organized under \"EHI Bulk Data Export\" in the left navigation. Key pages:\n\n- **EHI Export: Overview** — main landing page\n- **Creating a New Request: EHI Export** — user guide for initiating exports\n- **EHI Export FAQ** — frequently asked questions\n- **Glossary: Data Elements** — v1 through v5, field-level descriptions of all CSV files\n- **DrChrono EHI Export Reference Guides** — v1 through v4, technical reference with file structure, naming conventions, security model\n- **Single Patient and Bulk Export File/Folder Contents** — versioned XLSX data dictionaries (v1.0 through v1.8)\n- **Understanding EHI Data Mapping in Exported Files** — v1 and v2, guides for linking data across CSV files\n- **Unpacking Your DrChrono Export Files** — instructions for extracting .7z archives\n\n### Step 4: Downloaded XLSX data dictionaries\nThe \"Single Patient and Bulk Export File/Folder Contents\" page links to 8 versioned XLSX files hosted on CloudFront CDN:\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://dyzz9obi78pm5.cloudfront.net/app/image/id/6973ea26e257319ba90d046a/n/drchrono-ehi-export-documentation-v18.xlsx\" \\\n  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o drchrono-ehi-export-documentation-v18.xlsx\n```\nAll 8 files verified as genuine Microsoft Excel 2007+ files via `file` command.\n\n### Step 5: Downloaded HTML pages and PDFs\nFetched all key support articles as HTML. Also downloaded PDF exports of the Reference Guide v4 and Glossary v5 via KnowledgeOwl's `/home/pdfexport/id/` endpoint.\n\n### Step 6: Took browser screenshots\nNavigated to key pages in Chrome and captured full-page screenshots of: overview page, folder contents page, glossary v5, reference guide v4, and data mapping v2.\n\n### Step 7: Checked additional pages\n- `b10-exporter-media-file-mapping` — returned 404 (\"Article Not Found\"). This URL appears to have been retired.\n- `single-patient-and-bulk-exports` — a category/section page, not an article (no article body, just navigation links).\n\n## What Was Found\n\ndrchrono has built a dedicated, self-service EHI export system with comprehensive public documentation. This is one of the more thorough (b)(10) implementations encountered.\n\n### Export Format\n\nThe export produces a **ZIP archive containing CSV files** organized in a hierarchical folder structure:\n\n```\ndrchrono_data_export/\n├── <export_id>/\n│   ├── doctors/          (doctor/provider-related CSVs)\n│   ├── patients/         (patient-related CSVs)\n│   ├── practice_group/   (practice-level CSVs)\n│   ├── media/            (actual files: PDFs, images, faxes, etc.)\n│   └── README.txt\n```\n\nFor practice-level (bulk) exports, data is batched in groups of 50 patients, with numerically suffixed CSV files (e.g., `allergies_1.csv`, `allergies_2.csv`). Exports can reach 200+ GB for large practices. They're delivered as .7z multi-part archives for large exports.\n\n### Export Scope\n\n**Single patient export**: 98 CSV file types covering patient-specific data plus a doctors.csv file.\n\n**Bulk (practice-level) export**: 107 CSV file types, adding practice-wide data like office configurations, practice group info, custom vital types, syndromic surveillance logs, education resources, CCDA import files, and SOAP note custom reports.\n\nBoth export types also include a **Media folder** with actual files:\n- Clinical documents and uploaded patient documents\n- Doctor message attachments\n- HIPAA consent form files\n- Patient education resource files\n- DIRECT secure message attachments\n- Imported patient CCDA XML files\n- Inbound fax/referral files\n- Lab order document PDFs\n- Outbound referral files\n\n### Data Dictionary\n\nThe primary computable artifact is the **XLSX data dictionary** (latest: v1.8), which contains two sheets — \"Single Patient Export\" and \"Bulk Patient Export\". Each sheet has three columns: `Export Name` (CSV filename), `Field` (column name), and `Description` (human-readable explanation of the field).\n\nThe latest version (v1.8) documents:\n- **1,586 field definitions** for single patient export across 98 CSV files\n- **1,795 field definitions** for bulk patient export across 107 CSV files\n\nThe data dictionary has been actively maintained and expanded — from v1.0 (1,413/1,586 rows) through v1.8 (1,587/1,796 rows), with consistent growth across 8 versions.\n\n### Documentation Pages\n\nIn addition to the XLSX data dictionary, drchrono provides:\n\n1. **Reference Guides** (v1-v4): Technical documentation covering file naming conventions, directory structure, processing times, delivery options, security/access controls, and a complete listing of all data categories with brief descriptions.\n\n2. **Glossary: Data Elements** (v1-v5): Web-based field-level glossary organized by exporter (Doctor, Patient, Practice Group, Media). The latest version (v5, effective 1/28/2026) added race/ethnicity subcategory files.\n\n3. **Data Mapping Guides** (v1-v2): Instructions for joining data across CSV files using foreign key relationships (e.g., linking `uploaded_documents.csv` to `demographics.csv` via `patient_id`).\n\n4. **FAQ**: Practical guidance on export size expectations, technical requirements, handling blank CSVs, and interpretation of specific fields.\n\n5. **Creating a New Request**: Step-by-step user guide with screenshots for initiating single-patient and bulk exports via the EHR UI.\n\n## Export Coverage Assessment\n\n### Data Domain Coverage\n\nThis is a genuinely comprehensive (b)(10) export. Comparing against the product research, the export covers:\n\n**Clearly covered:**\n- **Patient demographics** — `demographics.csv` plus `patient_occupation.csv`, `tribal_affiliations.csv`, `ethnicity_subcategories.csv`, `race_subcategories.csv`, `uscdi_occupation_code.csv`, `uscdi_industry_code.csv`\n- **Clinical notes** — `clinical_notes.csv`, `clinical_note_archives.csv` (prior versions!), `custom_clinical_note_sections.csv`, `note_section_comments.csv`, `soap_note_line_item_field_value.csv`, `soap_note_line_item_field_type.csv`, `soap_note_custom_report.csv`\n- **Problems/diagnoses** — `problems.csv`\n- **Medications** — `patient_drug.csv`, `prescription.csv`, `prescription_message.csv`, `cover_my_meds_pa_request.csv`, `pa_request_medication.csv`\n- **Allergies** — `allergies.csv`, `allergy_snomed_code_mapping.csv`\n- **Lab orders and results** — `lab_order.csv`, `lab_order_document.csv`, `lab_order_icd10_codes.csv`, `lab_result.csv`, `lab_result_author.csv`, `patient_lab_result_set.csv`\n- **Immunizations** — `patient_vaccination_record.csv`, `patientvaccinerecord_doses.csv`, `iz_patient_demographic.csv`\n- **Vitals** — `system_vitals.csv`, `system_vitals_author.csv`, `custom_vital_value.csv`, `custom_vital_type.csv`\n- **Care plans** — 8 related CSV files covering plans, goals, interventions, objectives, authors, and attached codes\n- **Care team** — `care_team_member.csv`, `doctor_staff_care_team_members.csv`, `external_care_team_members.csv`, `patient_as_care_team_members.csv`\n- **Appointments** — `appointments.csv`\n- **Insurance/billing** — `claims.csv`, `payments_insurance.csv`, `payments_patient.csv`, `auto_accident_insurance.csv`, `auto_accident_insurance_accident.csv`, `primary_hospital_insurance.csv`, `workers_comp_insurance.csv`, `insurance_authorizations.csv`, `patient_cost_estimator.csv`\n- **Consent forms** — `consent_forms.csv`, `consent_form_assignments.csv`, `consent_form_signatures.csv`, `consent_form_signature_audit_logs.csv`\n- **Messages** — `patient_message.csv`, `patient_message_attachment.csv`, `doctor_message.csv`, `doctor_message_log.csv`, `direct_message.csv`, `direct_message_attachment.csv`, `history_message.csv`, `outgoing_patient_message_status.csv`, `prescription_message.csv`, `communication_log.csv`\n- **Documents** — `uploaded_documents.csv`, plus actual media files in clinical/, inbound_faxes/, referrals/ folders\n- **Referrals** — `inbound_referrals.csv`, `outbound_referrals.csv`\n- **Imaging orders** — `patient_imaging_order.csv`\n- **Device orders** — `patient_device_orders.csv`, `implantable_devices.csv`, `implantable_device_authors.csv`\n- **Family history** — `family_history.csv`, `clinical_observation.csv`, `clinical_observation_snomed_details.csv`, `person.csv`, `relationship.csv`\n- **Social history** — `social_history.csv`, `social_history_author.csv`\n- **Functional/mental status** — `functional_statuses.csv`, `functional_status_authors.csv`, `mental_statuses.csv`, `mental_status_authors.csv`\n- **Clinical decision support** — `clinical_decision_support_rules.csv`, `patient_specific_actions.csv`\n- **Patient education** — `education_resource.csv`, `education_resource_recommendation.csv`, `mu_patient_education_log.csv`\n- **Case reporting** — `case_report_encounters.csv`\n- **Syndromic surveillance** — `mu_syndromic_surveillance_log.csv`\n- **Patient flags** — `patient_flags.csv`\n- **Practice/office configuration** — `offices.csv`, `practice_group.csv`, `doctors.csv`\n- **CCDA imports** — `patient_import_ccda_file.csv`, `clinical_list.csv`\n- **Lab reference data** — `lab_quest_cd_order_code.csv`, `lab_quest_cd_order_code_aoe.csv`\n\n**Potentially missing or unclear:**\n- **Audit logs** — The product has an audit log feature (there's a separate support article for \"Exporting your audit logs\"), but no audit log CSV appears in the EHI export data dictionary. This is notable because audit logs are part of the EHI and are separately exportable.\n- **Task management** — The product has tasks with categories, notes, statuses, and templates (visible in the API), but no task-related CSVs appear in the export.\n- **Fee schedules and billing profiles** — While `claims.csv` and payment files are present, the API exposes /api/fee_schedules and /api/billing_profiles that don't appear as separate CSV files.\n- **Eligibility checks** — The API has /api/eligibility_checks but no corresponding CSV.\n- **Reminder profiles** — Appointment reminder configurations from the API aren't represented.\n- **Custom demographics** — The API has /api/custom_demographics but no dedicated CSV (may be embedded in demographics.csv).\n- **User/staff accounts and permissions** — The API has /api/users and /api/user_groups, but these aren't in the export.\n- **Yellow notepad** — Quick notes from the API (/api/yellow_notepad) don't appear as a CSV.\n- **Vaccine inventory** — Product tracks vaccine inventory, but only patient vaccination records are exported, not inventory management data.\n\nOverall, the export covers the vast majority of patient-facing clinical and administrative data. The gaps are mostly in administrative/configuration data (tasks, fee schedules, user management) and audit logs.\n\n### Export Format & Standards\n\n- **Format**: CSV files in a ZIP archive. This is an appropriate choice for a (b)(10) export — it's universally readable, requires no special tooling, and maps naturally to the relational data model of the underlying system.\n- **Not FHIR-based**: This is a genuine (b)(10) implementation, not a repackaged (g)(10) FHIR API. The CSV structure directly reflects the product's internal data model with many tables that have no FHIR equivalent (claims, consent form audit logs, SOAP note field values, clinical decision support rules, etc.).\n- **Relationships**: Foreign key relationships exist between CSV files (e.g., `patient_id` linking patient CSVs to `demographics.csv`). The data mapping guide explains how to join files.\n- **Media files**: Actual binary files (PDFs, images, faxes) are included alongside the CSV data, organized by type in the media/ folder.\n- **A third party could reconstruct the patient record**: The export includes both structured data (CSVs) and unstructured documents (media files), with documented relationships between them. The data mapping guides specifically address how to trace data across files.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\nThis is **excellent** documentation for an EHI export:\n\n- **Clear data dictionary**: The XLSX provides field-level definitions with `Export Name`, `Field`, and `Description` columns for every field in every CSV file. With ~1,796 field definitions across 107 CSV files (bulk export), this is genuinely granular.\n- **Versioned and maintained**: 8 XLSX versions (v1.0–v1.8), 4 reference guide versions, and 5 glossary versions. The documentation has changelog notes (e.g., v5 added ethnicity/race subcategory files).\n- **Multiple documentation formats**: XLSX data dictionary (computable), HTML web pages (browsable), PDF exports (archivable).\n- **Practical guidance**: The data mapping guides show specific examples of how to join CSV files. The FAQ addresses real-world concerns (export size, blank files, processing time). The unpacking guide covers .7z extraction.\n- **File structure documented**: The reference guide includes a directory tree showing the export hierarchy.\n- **Actively evolving**: Documentation dates range from mid-2024 through January 2026, with regular updates adding new data elements and improving structure.\n\nA developer could implement an import of this data based on the documentation. The XLSX data dictionary provides the schema, the reference guide explains the structure, and the data mapping guide shows how to join tables.\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\n- **Granularity**: Field-level documentation for every column in every CSV, with human-readable descriptions. This is more granular than most vendors provide.\n- **Data types**: Not explicitly stated in the XLSX (no \"data type\" column), though descriptions often imply the type (e.g., \"date of birth\", \"boolean flag\", \"unique ID\"). The lack of explicit data types (varchar, integer, date, etc.) is a minor gap.\n- **Value sets**: Coded fields are not documented with their possible values. For example, `phone_use` is described as \"type of the phone number (e.g., mobile, home)\" but the complete value set isn't provided.\n- **Relationships**: Foreign key relationships are not documented in the XLSX itself but are explained in the separate data mapping guide. The XLSX would benefit from a \"references\" column.\n- **Versioning**: Clear versioning with dates indicating which export version each document applies to (e.g., \"Relevant to exports completed AFTER 2/19/2025\").\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL: https://support.drchrono.com/home/20260096536987-ehi-export-overview (no redirects)\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no (all content accessible via curl, though browser needed for screenshots)\n- Navigation complexity: multi_page (hub with ~10 interconnected articles)\n- Anti-bot issues: none (no Cloudflare, no special headers required beyond User-Agent)\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\n- The `b10-exporter-media-file-mapping` page returns 404 — appears to have been retired/moved.\n- The `single-patient-and-bulk-exports` URL is a category page without article content.\n- The `ehi-export` URL is also a category landing page.\n- `openpyxl` Python module not available on system; XLSX analysis done via raw XML parsing of the ZIP contents.\n- Reference guide v4 page content was not fully extractable via simple HTML regex — KnowledgeOwl uses complex HTML structure.

No redirects. The page is a KnowledgeOwl-hosted support article.\n\n### Step 2: Fetched and examined the overview page\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://support.drchrono.com/home/20260096536987-ehi-export-overview\" \\\n  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o ehi-export-overview.html\n```\nThe overview page describes the EHI Export product — a self-service export feature compliant with 21st Century Cures Act. It links to a rich set of sub-pages.\n\n### Step 3: Identified documentation link structure\nSearched the HTML for EHI-related links and found an extensive documentation hub organized under \"EHI Bulk Data Export\" in the left navigation. Key pages:\n\n- **EHI Export: Overview** — main landing page\n- **Creating a New Request: EHI Export** — user guide for initiating exports\n- **EHI Export FAQ** — frequently asked questions\n- **Glossary: Data Elements** — v1 through v5, field-level descriptions of all CSV files\n- **DrChrono EHI Export Reference Guides** — v1 through v4, technical reference with file structure, naming conventions, security model\n- **Single Patient and Bulk Export File/Folder Contents** — versioned XLSX data dictionaries (v1.0 through v1.8)\n- **Understanding EHI Data Mapping in Exported Files** — v1 and v2, guides for linking data across CSV files\n- **Unpacking Your DrChrono Export Files** — instructions for extracting .7z archives\n\n### Step 4: Downloaded XLSX data dictionaries\nThe \"Single Patient and Bulk Export File/Folder Contents\" page links to 8 versioned XLSX files hosted on CloudFront CDN:\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://dyzz9obi78pm5.cloudfront.net/app/image/id/6973ea26e257319ba90d046a/n/drchrono-ehi-export-documentation-v18.xlsx\" \\\n  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o drchrono-ehi-export-documentation-v18.xlsx\n```\nAll 8 files verified as genuine Microsoft Excel 2007+ files via `file` command.\n\n### Step 5: Downloaded HTML pages and PDFs\nFetched all key support articles as HTML. Also downloaded PDF exports of the Reference Guide v4 and Glossary v5 via KnowledgeOwl's `/home/pdfexport/id/` endpoint.\n\n### Step 6: Took browser screenshots\nNavigated to key pages in Chrome and captured full-page screenshots of: overview page, folder contents page, glossary v5, reference guide v4, and data mapping v2.\n\n### Step 7: Checked additional pages\n- `b10-exporter-media-file-mapping` — returned 404 (\"Article Not Found\"). This URL appears to have been retired.\n- `single-patient-and-bulk-exports` — a category/section page, not an article (no article body, just navigation links).\n\n## What Was Found\n\ndrchrono has built a dedicated, self-service EHI export system with comprehensive public documentation. This is one of the more thorough (b)(10) implementations encountered.\n\n### Export Format\n\nThe export produces a **ZIP archive containing CSV files** organized in a hierarchical folder structure:\n\n```\ndrchrono_data_export/\n├── <export_id>/\n│   ├── doctors/          (doctor/provider-related CSVs)\n│   ├── patients/         (patient-related CSVs)\n│   ├── practice_group/   (practice-level CSVs)\n│   ├── media/            (actual files: PDFs, images, faxes, etc.)\n│   └── README.txt\n```\n\nFor practice-level (bulk) exports, data is batched in groups of 50 patients, with numerically suffixed CSV files (e.g., `allergies_1.csv`, `allergies_2.csv`). Exports can reach 200+ GB for large practices. They're delivered as .7z multi-part archives for large exports.\n\n### Export Scope\n\n**Single patient export**: 98 CSV file types covering patient-specific data plus a doctors.csv file.\n\n**Bulk (practice-level) export**: 107 CSV file types, adding practice-wide data like office configurations, practice group info, custom vital types, syndromic surveillance logs, education resources, CCDA import files, and SOAP note custom reports.\n\nBoth export types also include a **Media folder** with actual files:\n- Clinical documents and uploaded patient documents\n- Doctor message attachments\n- HIPAA consent form files\n- Patient education resource files\n- DIRECT secure message attachments\n- Imported patient CCDA XML files\n- Inbound fax/referral files\n- Lab order document PDFs\n- Outbound referral files\n\n### Data Dictionary\n\nThe primary computable artifact is the **XLSX data dictionary** (latest: v1.8), which contains two sheets — \"Single Patient Export\" and \"Bulk Patient Export\". Each sheet has three columns: `Export Name` (CSV filename), `Field` (column name), and `Description` (human-readable explanation of the field).\n\nThe latest version (v1.8) documents:\n- **1,586 field definitions** for single patient export across 98 CSV files\n- **1,795 field definitions** for bulk patient export across 107 CSV files\n\nThe data dictionary has been actively maintained and expanded — from v1.0 (1,413/1,586 rows) through v1.8 (1,587/1,796 rows), with consistent growth across 8 versions.\n\n### Documentation Pages\n\nIn addition to the XLSX data dictionary, drchrono provides:\n\n1. **Reference Guides** (v1-v4): Technical documentation covering file naming conventions, directory structure, processing times, delivery options, security/access controls, and a complete listing of all data categories with brief descriptions.\n\n2. **Glossary: Data Elements** (v1-v5): Web-based field-level glossary organized by exporter (Doctor, Patient, Practice Group, Media). The latest version (v5, effective 1/28/2026) added race/ethnicity subcategory files.\n\n3. **Data Mapping Guides** (v1-v2): Instructions for joining data across CSV files using foreign key relationships (e.g., linking `uploaded_documents.csv` to `demographics.csv` via `patient_id`).\n\n4. **FAQ**: Practical guidance on export size expectations, technical requirements, handling blank CSVs, and interpretation of specific fields.\n\n5. **Creating a New Request**: Step-by-step user guide with screenshots for initiating single-patient and bulk exports via the EHR UI.\n\n## Export Coverage Assessment\n\n### Data Domain Coverage\n\nThis is a genuinely comprehensive (b)(10) export. Comparing against the product research, the export covers:\n\n**Clearly covered:**\n- **Patient demographics** — `demographics.csv` plus `patient_occupation.csv`, `tribal_affiliations.csv`, `ethnicity_subcategories.csv`, `race_subcategories.csv`, `uscdi_occupation_code.csv`, `uscdi_industry_code.csv`\n- **Clinical notes** — `clinical_notes.csv`, `clinical_note_archives.csv` (prior versions!), `custom_clinical_note_sections.csv`, `note_section_comments.csv`, `soap_note_line_item_field_value.csv`, `soap_note_line_item_field_type.csv`, `soap_note_custom_report.csv`\n- **Problems/diagnoses** — `problems.csv`\n- **Medications** — `patient_drug.csv`, `prescription.csv`, `prescription_message.csv`, `cover_my_meds_pa_request.csv`, `pa_request_medication.csv`\n- **Allergies** — `allergies.csv`, `allergy_snomed_code_mapping.csv`\n- **Lab orders and results** — `lab_order.csv`, `lab_order_document.csv`, `lab_order_icd10_codes.csv`, `lab_result.csv`, `lab_result_author.csv`, `patient_lab_result_set.csv`\n- **Immunizations** — `patient_vaccination_record.csv`, `patientvaccinerecord_doses.csv`, `iz_patient_demographic.csv`\n- **Vitals** — `system_vitals.csv`, `system_vitals_author.csv`, `custom_vital_value.csv`, `custom_vital_type.csv`\n- **Care plans** — 8 related CSV files covering plans, goals, interventions, objectives, authors, and attached codes\n- **Care team** — `care_team_member.csv`, `doctor_staff_care_team_members.csv`, `external_care_team_members.csv`, `patient_as_care_team_members.csv`\n- **Appointments** — `appointments.csv`\n- **Insurance/billing** — `claims.csv`, `payments_insurance.csv`, `payments_patient.csv`, `auto_accident_insurance.csv`, `auto_accident_insurance_accident.csv`, `primary_hospital_insurance.csv`, `workers_comp_insurance.csv`, `insurance_authorizations.csv`, `patient_cost_estimator.csv`\n- **Consent forms** — `consent_forms.csv`, `consent_form_assignments.csv`, `consent_form_signatures.csv`, `consent_form_signature_audit_logs.csv`\n- **Messages** — `patient_message.csv`, `patient_message_attachment.csv`, `doctor_message.csv`, `doctor_message_log.csv`, `direct_message.csv`, `direct_message_attachment.csv`, `history_message.csv`, `outgoing_patient_message_status.csv`, `prescription_message.csv`, `communication_log.csv`\n- **Documents** — `uploaded_documents.csv`, plus actual media files in clinical/, inbound_faxes/, referrals/ folders\n- **Referrals** — `inbound_referrals.csv`, `outbound_referrals.csv`\n- **Imaging orders** — `patient_imaging_order.csv`\n- **Device orders** — `patient_device_orders.csv`, `implantable_devices.csv`, `implantable_device_authors.csv`\n- **Family history** — `family_history.csv`, `clinical_observation.csv`, `clinical_observation_snomed_details.csv`, `person.csv`, `relationship.csv`\n- **Social history** — `social_history.csv`, `social_history_author.csv`\n- **Functional/mental status** — `functional_statuses.csv`, `functional_status_authors.csv`, `mental_statuses.csv`, `mental_status_authors.csv`\n- **Clinical decision support** — `clinical_decision_support_rules.csv`, `patient_specific_actions.csv`\n- **Patient education** — `education_resource.csv`, `education_resource_recommendation.csv`, `mu_patient_education_log.csv`\n- **Case reporting** — `case_report_encounters.csv`\n- **Syndromic surveillance** — `mu_syndromic_surveillance_log.csv`\n- **Patient flags** — `patient_flags.csv`\n- **Practice/office configuration** — `offices.csv`, `practice_group.csv`, `doctors.csv`\n- **CCDA imports** — `patient_import_ccda_file.csv`, `clinical_list.csv`\n- **Lab reference data** — `lab_quest_cd_order_code.csv`, `lab_quest_cd_order_code_aoe.csv`\n\n**Potentially missing or unclear:**\n- **Audit logs** — The product has an audit log feature (there's a separate support article for \"Exporting your audit logs\"), but no audit log CSV appears in the EHI export data dictionary. This is notable because audit logs are part of the EHI and are separately exportable.\n- **Task management** — The product has tasks with categories, notes, statuses, and templates (visible in the API), but no task-related CSVs appear in the export.\n- **Fee schedules and billing profiles** — While `claims.csv` and payment files are present, the API exposes /api/fee_schedules and /api/billing_profiles that don't appear as separate CSV files.\n- **Eligibility checks** — The API has /api/eligibility_checks but no corresponding CSV.\n- **Reminder profiles** — Appointment reminder configurations from the API aren't represented.\n- **Custom demographics** — The API has /api/custom_demographics but no dedicated CSV (may be embedded in demographics.csv).\n- **User/staff accounts and permissions** — The API has /api/users and /api/user_groups, but these aren't in the export.\n- **Yellow notepad** — Quick notes from the API (/api/yellow_notepad) don't appear as a CSV.\n- **Vaccine inventory** — Product tracks vaccine inventory, but only patient vaccination records are exported, not inventory management data.\n\nOverall, the export covers the vast majority of patient-facing clinical and administrative data.
