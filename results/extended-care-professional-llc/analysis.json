        "description": "ECP is a specialty, vertically-integrated EHR and operational management platform built specifically for the senior living and long-term care (LTC) industry — particularly assisted living communities, independent living, memory care, I/DD programs, and group homes. It is NOT a general-purpose hospital or ambulatory EHR. The product consists of five integrated modules: eMAR (electronic medication administration with 600+ pharmacy integrations), EHR and Care Plans (assessments, care plans, task management, incident reporting, compliance automation), Billing (charge capture, payment processing, invoices, GL export), CRM (lead management, pipeline tracking), and Move-Ins (admissions workflow, digital document management). ECP serves 8,000+ communities with 120,000+ daily users across all 50 states. The certified module is the entire ECP platform, but the certification scope is extremely minimal — only (b)(10) EHI export, (d)(12)/(d)(13) authentication, and (g)(4)/(g)(5) quality/accessibility. No clinical criteria (a)(1)-(a)(14), no patient portal (e)(1), and no FHIR API (g)(7)-(g)(10) are certified, despite the product having clinical EHR capabilities.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "ECP's EHI export is a manual, report-based, user-driven process — not a database dump, not FHIR, not C-CDA. Users navigate the ECP UI to generate reports at three levels (company-wide via Executive Menu, location-level via Admin Menu, and resident-level via individual resident tiles), select which fields to include, and export results to Excel or PDF. There is no single 'export all EHI' button. Each data category (demographics, diagnoses, medications, vitals, etc.) requires navigating to a separate report and exporting it individually. For at least some reports (the Report Generator), users must manually select which fields to include — creating risk of incomplete exports if fields are not all selected. This is the least automated export approach possible: it pushes all the burden of completeness onto the end user, who must know which reports exist, navigate to each one, select appropriate fields, and export them one at a time.",

The screenshots reveal some data categories (report names visible in the UI) and some field names (visible in the field selection UI), but the documentation makes no attempt to enumerate all exportable data, describe data types, or document relationships between data elements. The Report Generator screenshot is cut off, so the full list of available report types is not even visible. This is among the thinnest EHI export documentation we have encountered.",

Based on the report names and field names visible in the screenshots, ECP appears to offer export of core clinical data categories relevant to long-term care (diagnoses, medications/MAR, vitals, assessments, care plans, incidents/falls). However, the export requires manual navigation to many separate reports with manual field selection, and there are significant gaps. The Billing module (charges, payments, invoices) is a core product feature but billing data is barely represented in the export documentation beyond 'Invoices from ECP' and 'Rent Roll' at the Admin level. CRM and Move-Ins module data (leads, family contacts, admissions documents, signed forms) does not appear at all. There is no evidence of messaging or communication data export. The Audit Log is present, which is a positive finding. Overall, the export appears to cover basic LTC clinical data but likely omits significant portions of what the broader ECP platform stores — particularly billing detail, CRM data, admissions documents, and any communication records.",
