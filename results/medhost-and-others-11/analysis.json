    "System and Patient Export are stated as 'not supported through FHIR API' on the developer portal — unclear what the actual export mechanism is for these modes",
    "No secure messaging/patient communication resource documented in the export",
    "No comprehensive audit trail resource in the export",
    "No sample export files or example NDJSON output provided",
    "Release date field in XLSX Main sheet is blank"

  "summary": "MEDHOST documents their EHI export as FHIR R4-based NDJSON files delivered in a ZIP archive. The primary documentation artifact is an XLSX file with 41 tabs documenting 708 extension fields that MEDHOST adds to standard FHIR R4 resources, including internal database column mappings. The export covers clinical data, billing (ChargeItem with CPT codes), insurance (Coverage with 30 fields), appointments, and procedures extensively. Notable gaps: no secure messaging resource, no audit trail resource, and no sample exports. The documentation approach is unusual — rather than documenting the full export schema, they document only their extensions to FHIR R4, expecting consumers to reference the FHIR R4 spec for base fields."
