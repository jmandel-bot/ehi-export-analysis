        "description": "InteliChart Patient Portal is not an EHR — it is an EHR-agnostic patient engagement platform that integrates with 40+ EHR systems (athenahealth, Cerner/Oracle, Allscripts, Meditech, NextGen, Nextech, Netsmart, Greenway, PointClickCare, etc.) via API. The certified module is part of the broader 'Healthy Outcomes' suite which includes eight modules: Patient Portal (record access hub), Patient Schedule (online self-scheduling), Patient Intake (digital registration, consent forms, insurance OCR capture), Patient Notify (appointment reminders), Family Portal (LTC/SNF family communication), Patient Survey (PHQ-9, satisfaction surveys, PROMs), Patient Activate (population health campaigns), and Patient eHealth (telehealth). While InteliChart receives clinical data from connected EHRs, it also generates and stores substantial portal-native data: secure messages, intake forms, survey responses, scheduling data, insurance card images, bill payments, campaign records, telehealth sessions, and family communications. This portal-native data is arguably the most important data InteliChart uniquely stores, yet the export appears focused on clinical data passthrough from the EHR.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The EHI export is primarily C-CDA/document-based. For single patients, the export produces a ZIP containing a C-CDA XML file (conformant to USCDI v1), encounter notes as PDF/HTML files, and patient documents as PDF/ZIP files. For patient population exports, the same per-patient structure applies with the addition of CSV data files. The overview PDF mentions FHIR Bulk Data Access (HL7 R4.0.1) and 'Clinical, Administrative and Financial reports,' but the detailed export structure described in the instructions is centered on C-CDA documents and PDF/HTML attachments. The method of export is described as 'CCDs through the Practice Portal' — essentially a clinical document export, not a database dump. The overview PDF references 'Data Format Specifications (ZIP)' files that are not publicly linked on the compliance page, so the detailed schema specifications are unavailable. This is a C-CDA-first approach that inherently limits what can be exported to what C-CDA supports, which excludes most portal-native data.",

There is no data dictionary, no field-level documentation, no schema definitions, no table or resource enumeration. The single patient and population export PDFs are nearly identical, differing only in the addition of CSV files for population exports. The overview PDF references 'Data Format Specifications (ZIP)' files that are not publicly available on the compliance page, suggesting the most detailed technical documentation is missing. The only specific format detail is the file naming convention and directory structure (C-CDA XML, encounter PDFs, patient document PDFs). Data elements are listed only as five high-level categories (Demographics, Clinical Notes, Vital Signs, Laboratory, Procedures) with no field-level breakdown. References USCDI v1 (July 2020), which is significantly outdated.",

        "overall_assessment": "The EHI export covers basic clinical data via C-CDA (demographics, notes, vitals, labs, procedures) and includes document attachments as PDFs. However, as a patient engagement platform that generates and stores substantial portal-native data — secure messages, intake forms, survey responses, scheduling history, insurance card captures, bill payments, campaign records, telehealth sessions, and family communications — the export appears to cover only the clinical data passthrough from connected EHRs while omitting the data InteliChart uniquely generates. The C-CDA format fundamentally cannot represent most of this portal-native data. The 'may include where applicable' qualifier on all content categories, the extremely thin documentation, and the missing specification ZIP files make it impossible to confirm exactly what is included. The mention of 'Clinical, Administrative and Financial reports' for population exports suggests some non-clinical data may be included as report documents, but no details are provided. Overall, this appears to be a minimal-effort compliance approach rather than a comprehensive EHI export.",

InteliChart's Patient Portal supports bidirectional secure messaging between patients and providers, and the Family Portal has threaded family-staff communications — both generating portal-native data that the platform stores. C-CDA has no standard mechanism for portal messaging threads. This is a significant gap: the data InteliChart uniquely generates (as opposed to clinical data passed through from the EHR) is not represented in the export."

No billing tables, charge records, payment details, or financial data structures are documented. The product has bill payment capabilities with flexible payment plans and copay collection through Patient Intake. The vague mention of 'financial reports' may refer to summary PDF reports rather than transactional billing data. Without the missing specification ZIP files, it is impossible to confirm what financial data, if any, is actually exported."

The Patient Schedule module provides full 24/7 online self-scheduling with two-way EHR integration, generating scheduling data that InteliChart stores.

This covers documents stored in the portal, though it's unclear whether all document types are included (e.g., OCR-captured insurance cards, uploaded images, faxes)."

        "'May include where applicable' qualifier on all content descriptions creates ambiguity about what patients actually receive.",
        "USCDI v1 (July 2020) reference is significantly outdated — USCDI v4 was current as of late 2024.",
        "Single patient and population export documentation is nearly identical — appears to be copied with minimal differentiation.",
        "Five explicitly listed data elements (Demographics, Clinical Notes, Vital Signs, Laboratory, Procedures) is a narrow subset even of what C-CDA supports.",

  "summary": "InteliChart LLC publishes minimal EHI export documentation (3 PDFs, 5 pages total) on a HubSpot-hosted compliance page behind an FAQ accordion. The export is C-CDA-based, covering basic clinical data from connected EHRs, but the InteliChart Patient Portal is a broad patient engagement platform with secure messaging, scheduling, intake forms, surveys, bill payment, and telehealth — most of which generates portal-native data that cannot be represented in C-CDA and appears absent from the export. Referenced specification ZIP files are not publicly linked. This is among the thinnest EHI export documentation we've encountered, raising significant questions about whether the export covers all EHI the product stores.",

  "notes": "The overview PDF references 'FHIR Bulk Data Access backed on HL7 Standard Release 4.0.1' and states it 'contains all available FHIR resources for the exported patient CCD/C-CDA Documents.' This phrasing is confusing — it seems to describe FHIR resources derived from C-CDA documents rather than a native FHIR export. The population export additionally mentions CSV files and 'Clinical, Administrative and Financial reports/images,' but no details are provided about what these contain. The certification criteria include (e)(1) for patient portal view/download/transmit and (e)(3) for patient health information capture, acknowledging that InteliChart captures patient-generated data, yet the export mechanism appears to exclude this data.
