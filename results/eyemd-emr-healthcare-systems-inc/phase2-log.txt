It supports FHIR Release 4 (R4) and adheres to the United States Core Data for Interoperability (US Core) v1 guidelines and requirements for data sharing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"general-information\">General Information</h1>\n<h2 id=\"smart-on-fhir\">SMART on FHIR</h2>\n<p>The API meets the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion §170.315(g)(10) in the 2015 Edition Cures Update. The API supports both SMART App Launch and SMART Backend Services v2.0.0.

They will then be prompted to authenticate using a Microsoft Live account. If the patient does not have a Microsoft Live account, they will be prompted to enter a code sent to the email they provide in the authentication form.</p>\n<h2 id=\"healthcare-providers--practices\">Healthcare Providers / Practices</h2>\n<p>To make patient data accessible via the FHIR API, some setup is required. First, your IT team must configure a port forward on your router to the EMR Gateway Server port. After this is done, EyeMD EMR will configure the FHIR API server to communicate with your Gateway server. To initiate this process, please contact Customer Service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-vendors\"><strong>Application Vendors</strong></h2>\n<p>Third-party application vendors interested in accessing the API must first complete a one-time <a href=\"https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir-app-registration/\">Application Registration Request</a>.

If your registration request is approved, your app will be registered and enabled, and you will receive an email that includes your credentials and configuration details. If your registration request is denied, you will receive an email with the stated reason for denial. If your request is denied more than 5 times for any reason, further requests will no longer be processed and will be discarded.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the Application Registration Requirement section below.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fees\">Fees</h1>\n<p><strong>Patients:</strong> Patients are not charged any fees to access their data using the FHIR API.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong> Practices using EyeMD EMR are charged a one-time FHIR setup fee of $300 to recover costs associated with integrating their local EMR instance to the FHIR API server. Ongoing throttled access to the API is included as part of the Patient Portal Subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Vendors:</strong> Application vendors are charged a one-time setup fee of $3,000 to recover costs associated with identity verification and registering the vendor as an approved application vendor. Vendors can request live API support for an additional $2,000. Once approved, the application vendor can make up to 300 API requests per endpoint per day for data authorized by any EyeMD EMR provider or patient.

This standard allows application developers to securely create products and exchange clinical data in a consistent, flexible, and easy-to-implement manner.</p>\n<p>The FHIR API is available for customers using EyeMD EMR version 2.0 or later. It supports FHIR Release 4 (R4) and adheres to the United States Core Data for Interoperability (US Core) v1 guidelines and requirements for data sharing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"general-information\">General Information</h1>\n<h2 id=\"smart-on-fhir\">SMART on FHIR</h2>\n<p>The API meets the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion §170.315(g)(10) in the 2015 Edition Cures Update. The API supports both SMART App Launch and SMART Backend Services v2.0.0. For more information, please visit <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/\">https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supported-application-types\">Supported Application Types</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Patient Apps</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Practitioner Apps (for Healthcare Providers / Practices)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Backend System Apps</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"fhir-server-capability-metadata\">FHIR Server Capability Metadata</h3>\n<p>Capability metadata can be queried by appending \"/metadata\" to the Endpoint Service Base URL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"patients\">Patients</h2>\n<p>Patients interested in connecting to the API using a SMART on FHIR capable app can do so by logging in to their provider's patient portal, scrolling down to the \"API Access\" section, and clicking the \"Request Access\" button. They will then be prompted to authenticate using a Microsoft Live account. If the patient does not have a Microsoft Live account, they will be prompted to enter a code sent to the email they provide in the authentication form.</p>\n<h2 id=\"healthcare-providers--practices\">Healthcare Providers / Practices</h2>\n<p>To make patient data accessible via the FHIR API, some setup is required. First, your IT team must configure a port forward on your router to the EMR Gateway Server port. After this is done, EyeMD EMR will configure the FHIR API server to communicate with your Gateway server. To initiate this process, please contact Customer Service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-vendors\"><strong>Application Vendors</strong></h2>\n<p>Third-party application vendors interested in accessing the API must first complete a one-time <a href=\"https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir-app-registration/\">Application Registration Request</a>. Once the registration request is received, it will be processed within 10 days.</p>\n<p>To register your App:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Navigate to <a href=\"https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir\">https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Review the API Documentation and agree to the Terms and Conditions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Complete the SMART on FHIR Application Registration Request form.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once your registration request is processed, we will send an email response to the supplied email address within 5 days. If your registration request is approved, your app will be registered and enabled, and you will receive an email that includes your credentials and configuration details. If your registration request is denied, you will receive an email with the stated reason for denial. If your request is denied more than 5 times for any reason, further requests will no longer be processed and will be discarded.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the Application Registration Requirement section below.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fees\">Fees</h1>\n<p><strong>Patients:</strong> Patients are not charged any fees to access their data using the FHIR API.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong> Practices using EyeMD EMR are charged a one-time FHIR setup fee of $300 to recover costs associated with integrating their local EMR instance to the FHIR API server. Ongoing throttled access to the API is included as part of the Patient Portal Subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Vendors:</strong> Application vendors are charged a one-time setup fee of $3,000 to recover costs associated with identity verification and registering the vendor as an approved application vendor. Vendors can request live API support for an additional $2,000. Once approved, the application vendor can make up to 300 API requests per endpoint per day for data authorized by any EyeMD EMR provider or patient. Requests exceeding this limit may be denied or rate-limited.

In the event of any conflict between these terms and other terms provided by us, the other terms will take precedence over these. Collectively, these terms, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines are referred to as the \"Terms\". You agree to abide by these Terms, which govern your relationship with us and/or our clients. Therefore, it is essential to carefully review all the Terms.</p>\n<p>Under these Terms, \"EyeMD EMR\" refers to EyeMD EMR Healthcare Systems, Inc., located at 27300 Riverview Center Blvd Suite 100, Bonita Springs, Florida, U.S.A. Throughout the Terms, \"EyeMD EMR\" may be referred to as \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\". \"API\" encompasses the FHIR API system and any endpoints or subsystems referenced in this API documentation.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, within these Terms, \"our clients\" or \"Healthcare Provider\" denotes any licensed active user of EyeMD EMR. The term \"You\" or \"Your\" includes anyone acting on your behalf, company employees, contractors, and any individuals who may directly or indirectly access and/or use the API or view information originating from the API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"restrictions\">Restrictions</h2>\n<p>You are prohibited from using the API if: (a) you are not of legal age to enter into a binding contract with EyeMD EMR, (b) you are barred from using or receiving APIs under the laws of the United States, your country of residence, or any other applicable jurisdiction, or (c) you are an Application Vendor that has not received an Application Registration approval.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-registration-requirement\">Application Registration Requirement</h2>\n<p>To gain access to the API, application vendors must submit specific information during the registration approval process. This requirement aims to enhance security and prevent misuse. It's crucial that any registration information provided to EyeMD EMR or our Clients is accurate, complete, and regularly updated.</p>\n<p>The Application Registration approval process includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ensuring all supplied information is accurate and complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ensuring all requested scopes are supported and appropriate for the stated use.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Confirming the request originated from a valid business entity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Verifying that the supplied email and URL domain owners match business entity public records. (Email addresses from public/free email provider domains will not be accepted.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ensuring the vendor has not previously been banned for violating these Terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Confirming the request did not originate from a blacklisted IP or domain address.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ensuring the request did not originate from a U.S. embargoed or sanctioned country.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Verifying that the stated reason for the connectivity request is legitimate and healthcare-oriented, serving the needs of patients, practitioners, researchers, or payers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other Reasons for Registration Denial:</p>\n<p>• No valid business entity identifiers (EIN/TIN).<br>• Vendor is a data aggregator that does not provide useful apps for patients/practitioners.<br>• Non-payment of fees.</p>\n<p>Failure to comply with the Terms outlined in this agreement may lead to the revocation of Application Registration privileges and may also result in IP bans as a consequence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compliance-with-law-third-party-rights-and-other-eyemd-emr-terms-of-service\">Compliance with Law, Third-Party Rights, and Other EyeMD EMR Terms of Service</h2>\n<p>You must adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and third-party rights when using the API. It is prohibited to use the API to facilitate, promote, or engage in any illegal activities or infringements upon third-party rights. Additionally, you are not permitted to use the API in a manner that contravenes any other terms of service with EyeMD EMR or our clients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-companies-employees-affiliates-and-contractors\">Your Companies Employee's, Affiliates and Contractors</h2>\n<p>You are required to ensure that your company's employees, affiliates, contractors, and anyone acting on your behalf, including those who may access information provided by the EyeMD EMR API directly or indirectly, comply with (and do not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable laws, regulations, and these Terms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"permitted-access\">Permitted Access</h2>\n<p>You should only access the API by the methods described in its documentation. Any assigned credentials should only be used for their intended purposes and should only be used to access records within the assigned access scopes. You must not hide, misrepresent, mask, or spoof your identity or your API Client's identity when using the API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-limitations\">API Limitations</h2>\n<p>EyeMD EMR, our clients, and affiliates may set and enforce limits on your use of the API (e.g., limiting the number of API requests you may make or the number of users you may serve), at their sole discretion. You agree not to attempt to circumvent these limitations as documented with each API. If you wish to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain express consent from EyeMD EMR, which may decline your request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>You shall use commercially reasonable efforts to protect information accessed by your API Client, including personally identifiable information (PII), from unauthorized access or use. You agree to promptly report any unauthorized access or use of such information to our clients, EyeMD EMR, and any required regulatory agency as required by law. Application vendors should evaluate their applications for the top 10 security vulnerabilities listed at <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\">https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/</a> and ensure their internal systems are patched, scanned for vulnerabilities, and monitored for suspicious activity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ownership\">Ownership</h2>\n<p>By using our API, you do not acquire ownership of any rights for our API or the content that is accessed through our API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-prohibitions\">API Prohibitions</h2>\n<p>When using the APIs, you may not (nor allow those acting on your behalf to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the API and offer it for use by third parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perform any action with the intent of introducing to EyeMD EMR products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Interfere with, overburden, or disrupt the API or the servers or networks providing the API.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Remove, obscure, or alter any EyeMD EMR terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified in writing by us, EyeMD EMR does not intend the use of the API to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (\"HIPAA\"), and makes no representations that the APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a \"covered entity\" or \"business associate\" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the API for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to any other party unless you have received prior written consent to such use from us or our clients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"confidentiality\">Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>Access credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) shall only be used by you to identify your API Client and access information intended for you. You will keep your credentials confidential and make commercially reasonable efforts to prevent others from using your credentials. Access credentials shall not be embedded in source code as plain text and shall be encrypted at rest and during transit.</p>\n<p>Our communications to you and our APIs may contain patient confidential information. Patient confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances or by HIPAA standards. If you receive any such information, you shall not disclose it to any third party without the patient's prior written consent or approval.</p>\n<h2 id=\"representation\">Representation</h2>\n<p>You shall not make any statement regarding your use of our API which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by EyeMD EMR without our prior written approval.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-of-logo-and-trademarks\">Use of Logo and Trademarks.</h2>\n<p>EyeMD EMR retains exclusive ownership of the trademarks represented by its company name, logo, products, and software. You shall use the name, logo, and trademarks of EyeMD EMR only in a manner approved in writing by EyeMD EMR. You shall not use the term \"EyeMD\" alone to describe any products or services provided by EyeMD EMR Healthcare Systems.</p>\n<p>When referencing our company or product names in integration literature or any type of written communication, you must use \"EyeMD EMR Healthcare Systems\" or \"EyeMD Electronic Medical Records\" fully spelled out as the first and most prominent use in any context. After this initial use, you may use the abbreviation \"EyeMD EMR\". The words \"EMR,\" \"EMR Healthcare Systems,\" or \"Electronic Medical Records\" must be at least 75% of the size of \"EyeMD\" when used together in written or printed form.</p>\n<p>You shall not challenge the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s registered trademark of the word \"EyeMD\" and will comply with any and all requests made by the American Academy of Ophthalmology regarding the term \"EyeMD\" and its related use with our company, products, and services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limitation-of-liability\">Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>When permitted by law, EyeMD EMR and our clients will not be responsible for the loss of profits, revenues, or data, financial losses, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of EyeMD EMR and our clients for any claim under these Terms, including any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us or our clients to use the applicable API. In all cases, EyeMD EMR and our clients will not be liable for any expense, loss, or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"indemnification\">Indemnification</h2>\n<p>Unless prohibited by applicable law, if you are a business, you will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless EyeMD EMR and our clients, directors, officers, employees, and users against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Your misuse, your end user's misuse, your contractor's misuse, or anyone acting on your behalf's misuse of the APIs;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Your violation, your end user's violation, your contractor's violation, or anyone acting on your behalf's violation of the Terms; or</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Any content or data routed into or used with the APIs by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"exceptions-and-errors\">Exceptions and Errors</h1>\n<p>Standard http response codes are being used for exceptions.

The final response is HTTP 200 with `content-type: text/html`.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the FHIR Resource Center page\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir/\" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o /tmp/page.html\n```\nThe page at `/fhir/` is titled \"FHIR Resource Center\" and is a simple WordPress/Elementor page with three items:\n1. **\"API Documentation\"** — links to `https://fhir.myeyecarerecords.com/api`\n2. **\"Application Registration Request\"** — links to `https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir-app-registration/`\n3. In the footer: **\"ONC Costs and Considerations\"** — links to `https://www.eyemdemr.com/mandatorydisclosures.pdf`\n\nNo mention of EHI, b(10), \"electronic health information,\" bulk export, or data dictionary anywhere on this page.\n\n### Step 3: Follow API Documentation link\n```bash\ncurl -sI -L \"https://fhir.myeyecarerecords.com/api\" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0'\n```\nThe API documentation URL redirects (HTTP 301) to a Postman collection at:\n`https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11861301/TVewYPfd`\n\nThis is the main API documentation — a comprehensive Postman collection documenting the EyeMD EMR FHIR API.\n\n### Step 4: Download the Postman collection JSON\n```bash\ncurl -s \"https://documenter.gw.postman.com/api/collections/11861301/TVewYPfd?segregateAuth=true&versionTag=latest\" \\\n  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -o eyemd-fhir-api-postman-collection.json\n```\nDownloaded the full Postman collection (3.99 MB JSON). This contains the complete API documentation including endpoint definitions, descriptions, parameters, sample requests/responses, USCDI mappings, terms of use, and setup instructions with embedded screenshots.\n\n### Step 5: Download mandatory disclosures PDF\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"https://www.eyemdemr.com/mandatorydisclosures.pdf\" -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' \\\n  -o mandatorydisclosures.pdf\n```\nSingle-page PDF listing costs for certified capabilities. Mentions `170.315(b)(12,10,11)` as covering \"Ability to send CCDA information to other systems via secure transmission\" — notably, the mandatory disclosures describe b(10) as CCDA transmission capability, not as a comprehensive EHI export.\n\n### Step 6: Fetch FHIR Endpoints Bundle\n```bash\ncurl -s \"https://smartonfhir.myeyecarerecords.com/fhir/Endpoint?_format=application/fhir+json&status=active&_count=1000\" \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/fhir+json' -o fhir-endpoints-bundle.json\n```\nSuccessfully retrieved a FHIR Bundle with 37 active endpoints (production customer instances).\n\n### Step 7: Attempt to find FHIR server metadata\nTried multiple paths on `fhir.myeyecarerecords.com` for CapabilityStatement and SMART configuration:\n- `/fhir/r4/metadata` → 404\n- `/fhir/metadata` → 404\n- `/metadata` → 404\n- `/.well-known/smart-configuration` → 404\n- `/api/*` paths → all redirect to Postman docs\n\nThe FHIR server appears to require a customer-specific endpoint identifier (e.g., `smartonfhir.myeyecarerecords.com/fhir/{ENDPOINT_ID}/metadata`), making the metadata endpoint inaccessible without customer credentials.\n\n### Step 8: Search for EHI-specific documentation\n- Searched the website text for terms: \"ehi\", \"b(10)\", \"electronic health information\", \"bulk\", \"export\", \"data dictionary\" — **no results** on any page.\n- WordPress search (`?s=ehi+export`) returned no results.\n- Checked `/mips/` (MACRA/MIPS certification page) — contains RWT test plans but no EHI export documentation.\n- Probed common paths: `/ehi/`, `/ehi-export/`, `/b10/`, `/compliance/`, `/interoperability/`, `/onc/`, `/legal/` — all redirect to existing pages or return 302/403.\n- `/compliance/` redirects to `/mips/`.\n- Checked Wayback Machine for archived versions — no captures found.\n- Google site search for \"site:eyemdemr.com EHI export b10\" — no relevant results.\n\n## What Was Found\n\nEyeMD EMR's registered (b)(10) EHI export URL points to their **FHIR Resource Center**, which in turn links to their **FHIR API documentation** hosted as a Postman collection. There is **no separate (b)(10) EHI export documentation** — the vendor has registered their FHIR API documentation as their EHI export documentation.\n\n### The FHIR API Documentation\n\nThe Postman collection is comprehensive as FHIR API documentation goes. It covers:\n\n**FHIR Resources supported (approximately 25 resource types):**\nAllergyIntolerance, CarePlan, CareTeam, Condition, Coverage, Device, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, Encounter, Goal, Group, Immunization, Location, Medication, MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense, Observation, Organization, Patient, Practitioner, Procedure, Provenance, QuestionnaireResponse, RelatedPerson, ServiceRequest, Specimen\n\n**Bulk Data Export:**\nThere is an \"Export\" section with two endpoints:\n- `GET /Group/{id}/$export` — Start Group Export (FHIR Bulk Data)\n- `GET /_operations/export/{id}/{uuid}/{ResourceType}-{n}.ndjson` — Get Export File\n\nThese endpoints have no descriptions or documentation beyond the URL patterns. No documentation about what resource types are included in the export, whether it covers all data or just USCDI, or how to interpret the output files.\n\n**USCDI v3 Mappings:**\nThe documentation includes a complete USCDI v3 mapping table showing how each USCDI data class/element maps to US Core profiles and FHIR resources. This covers the standard clinical data classes: Allergies, Assessment/Plan, Care Team, Clinical Notes, Clinical Tests, Diagnostic Imaging, Encounters, Goals, Health Insurance, Health Status/Assessments, Immunizations, Laboratory, Medications, Patient Demographics, Problems, Procedures, Provenance, Unique Device Identifiers, and Vital Signs.\n\n**CCD Generation:**\nThere's a `DocumentReference?patient={id}&type=ALLDATA` endpoint that \"outputs a CCDA R2 Continuity of Care Document, encoded in base64 format.\" This appears to be the closest thing to a comprehensive patient data export, but it's a CCD — a clinical summary format — not a complete EHI export.\n\n**Architecture:**\nEach EyeMD EMR customer operates in a \"partitioned and isolated data environment\" with a unique service base URL (e.g., `smartonfhir.myeyecarerecords.com/fhir/{ENDPOINT_ID}`). The system uses a \"Fog & Edge Computing\" desktop architecture where the EMR runs locally, with a gateway server that connects to the cloud FHIR API. Practices must configure port forwarding and have EyeMD configure the FHIR API server.\n\n**Fees:**\n- Patients: Free\n- Practices: $300 one-time FHIR setup fee\n- Application Vendors: $3,000 one-time registration fee; 300 API requests per endpoint per day limit\n\n## Export Coverage Assessment\n\n### Data Domain Coverage\n\nThe product research reveals EyeMD EMR stores a rich set of ophthalmology-specific data across multiple modules. The FHIR API documentation covers only the standard USCDI/US Core clinical data classes. Here is the gap analysis:\n\n**Clearly covered (via FHIR API / USCDI mappings):**\n- Patient demographics (standard fields)\n- Allergies and intolerances\n- Conditions/problems\n- Medications (requests and dispense)\n- Immunizations\n- Lab results and diagnostic reports\n- Vital signs\n- Procedures\n- Care plans and care teams\n- Clinical notes (via DocumentReference)\n- Encounters\n- Health insurance/coverage\n- Implantable devices\n- Provenance\n- Goals\n- SDOH assessments (QuestionnaireResponse)\n- Related persons\n\n**Clearly missing or undocumented:**\n- **Ophthalmic examination data** — slit lamp findings, visual acuity measurements, intraocular pressure (IOP), refraction data, optical mathematical formulas. This is the core clinical data for an ophthalmology EMR and there is no documentation of how it would be exported. These are likely represented as Observations but no ophthalmology-specific coding or mapping is documented.\n- **Diagnostic imaging data** — OCT scans, fundus photographs, visual fields, B-scan ultrasound, HRT, ICG/ICGA, autofluorescence images. The product integrates with devices from Zeiss, iCare, iTrace, Heidelberg, Topcon, and Oculus. None of this imaging data appears in the export documentation. DICOM images are not mentioned.\n- **Imaging progression/history** — a key clinical feature, not documented for export.\n- **Practice management data** — appointment schedules, waitlists, recall lists. Only Encounter is documented, which is a clinical concept, not scheduling.\n- **Billing and claims data** — insurance claims, claim tracking, patient financial responsibility, payments, eStatements. The Coverage resource covers insurance information, but actual billing/claims transactions are absent.\n- **Optical shop data** — frame/contact lens inventory, optical orders, lab orders, point-of-sale transactions, financial reporting. Entirely absent.\n- **Patient engagement data** — digital intake forms, consent documents, two-way messages, appointment reminders, marketing/prequalification data. Only QuestionnaireResponse covers some intake; the rest is absent.\n- **E-prescribing details** — while MedicationRequest and MedicationDispense are present, ophthalmology-specific prescriptions (optical Rx transmitted to optical shop) are not distinguished.\n- **Surgical documentation** — procedure records exist but specialty surgical documentation (e.g., cataract surgery parameters, IOL calculations) is not specifically addressed.\n- **Business intelligence/reporting data** — the product's BI dashboard data is not exportable.\n- **Fax records** — the built-in fax system's inbound/outbound records are not mentioned.\n- **Audit logs** — not mentioned in the export documentation.\n- **Custom templates and clinical verbiage** — the product supports extensive customization, but this configuration data is not exportable.\n- **E&M coding data** — automated E&M code suggestions are a product feature but not represented in exports.\n\n### Export Format & Standards\n\nThe export uses **FHIR R4** with **US Core v1/STU6.1 profiles** via a **FHIR Bulk Data Export** (`$export`) endpoint producing **NDJSON** files. This is a standard, well-understood format.\n\nHowever, this is explicitly the **(g)(10) standardized API**, not a purpose-built (b)(10) EHI export. The documentation itself states: \"The API meets the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion §170.315(g)(10).\" There is no mention of §170.315(b)(10) anywhere in any of the documentation.\n\nThe FHIR format is appropriate for the USCDI clinical data it covers but is fundamentally inadequate for the ophthalmology-specific data that makes this product unique: high-resolution diagnostic images, complex optical measurements, surgical parameters, and specialty-specific clinical documentation. A FHIR US Core export of an ophthalmology EMR captures the generic clinical layer but misses the specialty-specific layer that constitutes the bulk of the clinical value.\n\nThe CCD generation endpoint (`type=ALLDATA`) produces a C-CDA document, which is even more constrained than the FHIR API — it's a clinical summary format, not a comprehensive data export.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\nThe FHIR API documentation is **well-structured and reasonably detailed** as API documentation for a (g)(10) FHIR API:\n- Each resource type has search parameters documented with types and descriptions\n- There are setup instructions with embedded screenshots\n- Authentication (SMART on FHIR / OAuth2) is documented\n- Error handling and pagination are explained\n- USCDI v3 mapping tables are comprehensive\n- Terms of use are thorough\n\nHowever, as EHI export documentation, it is **fundamentally inadequate**:\n- There is no data dictionary — no field-level documentation of what the EMR stores vs. what the API exposes\n- There are no value sets or coded field definitions specific to ophthalmology\n- The Bulk Data Export endpoints have zero documentation (no descriptions, no example output, no list of included resource types)\n- There is no discussion of data completeness or what data is NOT included\n- There is no mention of (b)(10), EHI, or \"all electronic health information\"\n- No sample export files or example data\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\nThe documentation is structured as a Postman collection with folders per resource type. Each folder typically contains Search and Get operations with parameter tables. The USCDI mapping section provides a crosswalk from USCDI data classes to FHIR resources.\n\n**What's present:**\n- Resource-level documentation (which resources are supported)\n- Search parameter tables (parameter name, type, description)\n- USCDI v3 to FHIR resource mapping\n- Authentication and authorization flow\n- Setup instructions for patients, practices, and vendors\n\n**What's absent:**\n- No field-level data dictionary (what specific data elements populate each FHIR resource)\n- No ophthalmology-specific documentation (how specialty data maps to FHIR)\n- No export documentation (what the $export endpoint actually produces)\n- No value sets or terminology bindings\n- No sample data or example responses for export files\n- No documentation of custom FHIR extensions (though the Endpoints bundle shows they use custom extensions like `endpoint-environment` and `emr-version`)\n- No versioning or change history for the export\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nEyeMD EMR has registered their FHIR API documentation — which is clearly their (g)(10) standardized API — as their (b)(10) EHI export documentation. This is a textbook case of the (b)(10) vs. (g)(10) conflation. The documentation explicitly references §170.315(g)(10) and USCDI/US Core, and never mentions (b)(10) or EHI.\n\nFor a specialty ophthalmology EMR that stores diagnostic imaging, complex optical measurements, surgical documentation, optical shop inventory, and practice management data, a FHIR US Core API covers perhaps 20-30% of the data the product actually stores. The most clinically and operationally valuable data — the ophthalmology-specific content — has no documented export path.\n\nThe FHIR API itself appears functional (37 active production endpoints) and the documentation is adequate for its purpose as a (g)(10) API. But as (b)(10) EHI export documentation, it fails to describe how to export the vast majority of data the system stores.\n\nThe mandatory disclosures PDF is particularly telling: it describes capabilities `170.315(b)(12,10,11)` collectively as \"Ability to send CCDA information to other systems via secure transmission\" — equating the EHI export requirement with CCDA transmission, which is actually the (b)(1) transitions of care capability, not (b)(10).\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL (after redirects): https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir/\n- API docs URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11861301/TVewYPfd\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no (curl works for all content)\n- Navigation complexity: one_click (main page → Postman docs)\n- Anti-bot issues: none\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\n- The FHIR server at `fhir.myeyecarerecords.com` requires customer-specific endpoint identifiers; standard paths like `/metadata` return 404.

This is a standard, well-understood format.\n\nHowever, this is explicitly the **(g)(10) standardized API**, not a purpose-built (b)(10) EHI export. The documentation itself states: \"The API meets the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion §170.315(g)(10).\" There is no mention of §170.315(b)(10) anywhere in any of the documentation.\n\nThe FHIR format is appropriate for the USCDI clinical data it covers but is fundamentally inadequate for the ophthalmology-specific data that makes this product unique: high-resolution diagnostic images, complex optical measurements, surgical parameters, and specialty-specific clinical documentation. A FHIR US Core export of an ophthalmology EMR captures the generic clinical layer but misses the specialty-specific layer that constitutes the bulk of the clinical value.\n\nThe CCD generation endpoint (`type=ALLDATA`) produces a C-CDA document, which is even more constrained than the FHIR API — it's a clinical summary format, not a comprehensive data export.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\nThe FHIR API documentation is **well-structured and reasonably detailed** as API documentation for a (g)(10) FHIR API:\n- Each resource type has search parameters documented with types and descriptions\n- There are setup instructions with embedded screenshots\n- Authentication (SMART on FHIR / OAuth2) is documented\n- Error handling and pagination are explained\n- USCDI v3 mapping tables are comprehensive\n- Terms of use are thorough\n\nHowever, as EHI export documentation, it is **fundamentally inadequate**:\n- There is no data dictionary — no field-level documentation of what the EMR stores vs. what the API exposes\n- There are no value sets or coded field definitions specific to ophthalmology\n- The Bulk Data Export endpoints have zero documentation (no descriptions, no example output, no list of included resource types)\n- There is no discussion of data completeness or what data is NOT included\n- There is no mention of (b)(10), EHI, or \"all electronic health information\"\n- No sample export files or example data\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\nThe documentation is structured as a Postman collection with folders per resource type. Each folder typically contains Search and Get operations with parameter tables. The USCDI mapping section provides a crosswalk from USCDI data classes to FHIR resources.\n\n**What's present:**\n- Resource-level documentation (which resources are supported)\n- Search parameter tables (parameter name, type, description)\n- USCDI v3 to FHIR resource mapping\n- Authentication and authorization flow\n- Setup instructions for patients, practices, and vendors\n\n**What's absent:**\n- No field-level data dictionary (what specific data elements populate each FHIR resource)\n- No ophthalmology-specific documentation (how specialty data maps to FHIR)\n- No export documentation (what the $export endpoint actually produces)\n- No value sets or terminology bindings\n- No sample data or example responses for export files\n- No documentation of custom FHIR extensions (though the Endpoints bundle shows they use custom extensions like `endpoint-environment` and `emr-version`)\n- No versioning or change history for the export\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nEyeMD EMR has registered their FHIR API documentation — which is clearly their (g)(10) standardized API — as their (b)(10) EHI export documentation. This is a textbook case of the (b)(10) vs. (g)(10) conflation. The documentation explicitly references §170.315(g)(10) and USCDI/US Core, and never mentions (b)(10) or EHI.\n\nFor a specialty ophthalmology EMR that stores diagnostic imaging, complex optical measurements, surgical documentation, optical shop inventory, and practice management data, a FHIR US Core API covers perhaps 20-30% of the data the product actually stores. The most clinically and operationally valuable data — the ophthalmology-specific content — has no documented export path.\n\nThe FHIR API itself appears functional (37 active production endpoints) and the documentation is adequate for its purpose as a (g)(10) API. But as (b)(10) EHI export documentation, it fails to describe how to export the vast majority of data the system stores.\n\nThe mandatory disclosures PDF is particularly telling: it describes capabilities `170.315(b)(12,10,11)` collectively as \"Ability to send CCDA information to other systems via secure transmission\" — equating the EHI export requirement with CCDA transmission, which is actually the (b)(1) transitions of care capability, not (b)(10).\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL (after redirects): https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir/\n- API docs URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11861301/TVewYPfd\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no (curl works for all content)\n- Navigation complexity: one_click (main page → Postman docs)\n- Anti-bot issues: none\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\n- The FHIR server at `fhir.myeyecarerecords.com` requires customer-specific endpoint identifiers; standard paths like `/metadata` return 404. Could not retrieve a CapabilityStatement directly.\n- The `/compliance/` path redirects to `/mips/`, not to a compliance hub.\n- No Wayback Machine captures of the registered URL.\n- Website search for \"ehi export\" returns no results.\n- Google site search found no EHI-specific documentation.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
