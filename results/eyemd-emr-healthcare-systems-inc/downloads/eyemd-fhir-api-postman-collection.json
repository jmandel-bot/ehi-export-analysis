This standard allows application developers to securely create products and exchange clinical data in a consistent, flexible, and easy-to-implement manner.</p>\n<p>The FHIR API is available for customers using EyeMD EMR version 2.0 or later. It supports FHIR Release 4 (R4) and adheres to the United States Core Data for Interoperability (US Core) v1 guidelines and requirements for data sharing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"general-information\">General Information</h1>\n<h2 id=\"smart-on-fhir\">SMART on FHIR</h2>\n<p>The API meets the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion §170.315(g)(10) in the 2015 Edition Cures Update. The API supports both SMART App Launch and SMART Backend Services v2.0.0. For more information, please visit <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/\">https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supported-application-types\">Supported Application Types</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Patient Apps</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Practitioner Apps (for Healthcare Providers / Practices)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Backend System Apps</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"fhir-server-capability-metadata\">FHIR Server Capability Metadata</h3>\n<p>Capability metadata can be queried by appending \"/metadata\" to the Endpoint Service Base URL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"patients\">Patients</h2>\n<p>Patients interested in connecting to the API using a SMART on FHIR capable app can do so by logging in to their provider's patient portal, scrolling down to the \"API Access\" section, and clicking the \"Request Access\" button. They will then be prompted to authenticate using a Microsoft Live account. If the patient does not have a Microsoft Live account, they will be prompted to enter a code sent to the email they provide in the authentication form.</p>\n<h2 id=\"healthcare-providers--practices\">Healthcare Providers / Practices</h2>\n<p>To make patient data accessible via the FHIR API, some setup is required. First, your IT team must configure a port forward on your router to the EMR Gateway Server port. After this is done, EyeMD EMR will configure the FHIR API server to communicate with your Gateway server. To initiate this process, please contact Customer Service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-vendors\"><strong>Application Vendors</strong></h2>\n<p>Third-party application vendors interested in accessing the API must first complete a one-time <a href=\"https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir-app-registration/\">Application Registration Request</a>. Once the registration request is received, it will be processed within 10 days.</p>\n<p>To register your App:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Navigate to <a href=\"https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir\">https://www.eyemdemr.com/fhir</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Review the API Documentation and agree to the Terms and Conditions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Complete the SMART on FHIR Application Registration Request form.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once your registration request is processed, we will send an email response to the supplied email address within 5 days. If your registration request is approved, your app will be registered and enabled, and you will receive an email that includes your credentials and configuration details. If your registration request is denied, you will receive an email with the stated reason for denial. If your request is denied more than 5 times for any reason, further requests will no longer be processed and will be discarded.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the Application Registration Requirement section below.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fees\">Fees</h1>\n<p><strong>Patients:</strong> Patients are not charged any fees to access their data using the FHIR API.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong> Practices using EyeMD EMR are charged a one-time FHIR setup fee of $300 to recover costs associated with integrating their local EMR instance to the FHIR API server. Ongoing throttled access to the API is included as part of the Patient Portal Subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Vendors:</strong> Application vendors are charged a one-time setup fee of $3,000 to recover costs associated with identity verification and registering the vendor as an approved application vendor. Vendors can request live API support for an additional $2,000. Once approved, the application vendor can make up to 300 API requests per endpoint per day for data authorized by any EyeMD EMR provider or patient. Requests exceeding this limit may be denied or rate-limited. Additional transactions are available on a quoted basis.</p>\n<h1 id=\"setup-instructions\">Setup Instructions</h1>\n<p><strong>Patients:</strong></p>\n<p>1.

You agree to promptly report any unauthorized access or use of such information to our clients, EyeMD EMR, and any required regulatory agency as required by law. Application vendors should evaluate their applications for the top 10 security vulnerabilities listed at <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\">https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/</a> and ensure their internal systems are patched, scanned for vulnerabilities, and monitored for suspicious activity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ownership\">Ownership</h2>\n<p>By using our API, you do not acquire ownership of any rights for our API or the content that is accessed through our API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-prohibitions\">API Prohibitions</h2>\n<p>When using the APIs, you may not (nor allow those acting on your behalf to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Sublicense an API for use by a third party.

Observations are not made on specimens themselves; they are made on a subject, but in many cases by the means of a specimen. Note that although specimens are often involved, they are not always tracked and reported explicitly. Also note that observation resources may be used in contexts that track the specimen explicitly (e.g. Diagnostic Report).\",\r\n        \"min\": 0,\r\n        \"max\": \"1\",\r\n        \"base\": {\r\n          \"path\": \"Observation.specimen\",\r\n          \"min\": 0,\r\n          \"max\": \"1\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"type\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"code\": \"Reference\",\r\n            \"targetProfile\": [\r\n              \"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Specimen\"\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"constraint\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"key\": \"ele-1\",\r\n            \"severity\": \"error\",\r\n            \"human\": \"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children\",\r\n            \"expression\": \"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())\",\r\n            \"xpath\": \"@value|f:*|h:div\",\r\n            \"source\": \"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element\"\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"isModifier\": false,\r\n        \"isSummary\": false,\r\n        \"mapping\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"identity\": \"sct-concept\",\r\n            \"map\": \"< 123038009 |Specimen|\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"identity\": \"v2\",\r\n            \"map\": \"SPM segment\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"identity\": \"rim\",\r\n            \"map\": \"participation[typeCode=SPC].specimen\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"identity\": \"sct-attr\",\r\n            \"map\": \"704319004 |Inherent in|\"\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"Observation.device\",\r\n        \"path\": \"Observation.device\",\r\n        \"short\": \"(Measurement) Device\",\r\n        \"definition\": \"The device used to generate the observation data.\",\r\n        \"comment\": \"Note that this is not meant to represent a device involved in the transmission of the result, e.g., a gateway.
