        "description": "Neo is a custom-built, internally-developed EHR system created by Kennebec Behavioral Health (KBH), a nonprofit community behavioral health center in central Maine. It is NOT a commercial product — it was built by a single software architect (Scott Bressette) for KBH's exclusive use. KBH is a CARF-accredited, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) serving 200+ towns from 20+ locations, providing mental health services, substance use disorder treatment, 24/7 crisis services, and community rehabilitation. Neo is a comprehensive system covering clinical documentation (diagnoses, treatment plans, progress notes, assessments), scheduling, billing/payor management, internal messaging ('Neo Email'), client text messaging, document management, and a patient portal (clientportal.kbhmaine.org). It's built on ASP.NET MVC with DevExpress/jQuery, with a Xamarin mobile app. The ONC certification is limited to 16 criteria — notably absent are FHIR API access (g)(10) and clinical quality measures, making the b(10) EHI export the primary structured data export pathway.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The EHI export uses a two-part approach: (1) An 'Export Data' button that downloads an XML file 'in the same format as CDA files' containing 'all the background client information, such as addresses and phone numbers' — this is essentially a C-CDA document with demographics and basic clinical data. (2) A 'Chart Printing' / 'Run Report' function that exports selected document types as PDF files. Users must manually select which document types to include. The documentation also states 'Contact IT Support if you would like to export the complete client dataset,' strongly implying the self-service export is incomplete. This C-CDA + PDF approach is one of the weakest patterns for EHI completeness — C-CDA covers clinical summaries but inherently cannot represent billing, insurance authorizations, portal messages, scheduling details, or audit trails. PDF exports are documents, not structured data.",

      "documentation_quality": {
        "description": "The documentation is among the most minimal we have encountered. The entire EHI export 'documentation' consists of a ~150-word FAQ article describing three UI steps (navigate to Chart Printing, click Export Data, click Run Report) plus a single sentence on the linked Chart Printing page ('Chart printing is the primary method of exporting Neo data'). There is no data dictionary, no field listing, no schema documentation, no list of available document types, no description of what data elements are included in the CDA/XML export, and no downloadable specification of any kind. The documentation reads as internal user instructions rather than a specification of export content — it tells users how to click buttons, not what data they will receive.",

      "ehi_coverage": {
        "overall_assessment": "The export documentation is too vague to make definitive coverage assessments — it describes a process (click these buttons) rather than content (these data elements are exported). What we can infer: the CDA/XML export covers demographics ('addresses and phone numbers') and presumably basic clinical data per CDA standards. The PDF export covers whatever document types exist in the system. But Neo is a comprehensive behavioral health EHR with scheduling, billing, messaging, a patient portal, and document management. The CDA + PDF export approach is structurally incapable of capturing most non-clinical data categories. The documentation's own instruction to 'Contact IT Support for the complete client dataset' confirms the self-service export is incomplete. Given the product's capabilities and the export's inherent format limitations, significant gaps in billing, insurance, messaging, and scheduling data are virtually certain.",

CDA format inherently carries clinical summary data (diagnoses, medications, allergies, etc.). The PDF 'Run Report' exports clinical documents (progress notes, treatment plans, assessments). However, no specific clinical data elements or document types are enumerated in the documentation."

          "present": false,

Neo has both a 'Neo Email' internal messaging system and client text messaging (one-way and response-requested), confirmed via the KBH University support site. Neither CDA format nor PDF chart printing would naturally capture these communication records. This is a significant gap — patient-provider communications are part of the Designated Record Set."

Neo has client accounts, payor management, credit card payment processing, and MaineCare (Medicaid) authorization management. CDA format does not carry billing line items, and chart-printed PDFs would not include transactional financial data. Billing data is part of the Designated Record Set."
        },
        "insurance_coverage": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "No mention of insurance, coverage, eligibility, or authorization data in the export documentation. Neo manages MaineCare authorizations and payor information. CDA has limited insurance representation. This data would not appear in PDF chart exports."

        "appointments_scheduling": {
          "present": false,
          "evidence": "No mention of appointments or scheduling in the export documentation.

          "present": true,
          "evidence": "The PDF 'Run Report' function is specifically designed to export documents. Users 'select all the document types you would like to export.' The documentation notes PDFs generated within Neo are machine-readable, but faxed documents are image-only. However, no list of available document types is provided, and users must manually select which types to include — there's no clear 'select all' indication. Neo also has document scanning via the Staff App."

      "issues": [
        "Extremely minimal documentation: ~150 words describing UI clicks, with no data dictionary, field listing, or schema documentation of any kind. This does not meet the spirit of the b(10) requirement to document what data is exported.",
        "CDA + PDF export format is structurally incapable of representing billing, insurance, messaging, scheduling, and audit data — all of which Neo stores.",
        "Self-service export appears incomplete: documentation explicitly states 'Contact IT Support if you would like to export the complete client dataset,' suggesting staff intervention is required for a full export.",
        "No enumeration of what document types are available for PDF export, making it impossible to assess completeness from the documentation alone.",
        "The CDA/XML export is described only as containing 'addresses and phone numbers' — unclear if it includes clinical data beyond demographics.",
        "No FHIR API certification (g)(10), so there is no alternative structured data access path. The EHI export is the only way beyond the portal for patients to get their data.",
        "SSL certificate issues on the support site suggest infrastructure maintenance gaps.",
        "Being a single-organization, self-developed system with no external customer base, there is limited external pressure for comprehensive export documentation or functionality."

  "notes": "Neo's ONC certification was achieved by a nonprofit behavioral health organization that built its own EHR. The developer contact (Scott Bressette) is the Director of Training / Principal Software Architect at KBH. Per his professional profile, the certification process 'generated a half million dollars in grants' for KBH. The system lacks FHIR API certification (g)(10), making the b(10) EHI export the only mechanism for bulk data access beyond the patient portal. The support site (KBH University) is a general IT knowledge base for KBH staff, not a dedicated EHI documentation site."
