  "issues": [
    "No data dictionary or field-level documentation — only workflow/process instructions for generating exports",
    "No schema definition (DDL, JSON Schema, XSD) or structural documentation of what fields the export contains",
    "Export relies on standard formats (C-CDA 2.1, QRDA I) rather than custom format, so HL7 specifications serve as implicit schema documentation",
    "CQMsolution's claim that 'QRDA I output XML contains all EHI' is questionable — QRDA I is a quality reporting format, not a general-purpose EHI container. It contains clinical observations relevant to quality measures, not billing, scheduling, messaging, or administrative data",
    "ConnectEHR C-CDA export covers standard clinical domains but C-CDA does not include billing, insurance details, secure messages, audit trails, or custom data",
    "No sample export files or test data provided",
    "Overview tab discusses FHIR DocumentReference expansion beyond CCD as aspirational ('preparing to expand') rather than current capability",
    "Documentation does not address how 'all EHI' including non-clinical data domains (billing, scheduling, messaging) would be exported"
  ],
  "summary": "Dynamic Health IT provides a single HTML page documenting EHI export for two products. ConnectEHR exports patient data as C-CDA 2.1 XML via a batch admin interface (7-step UI walkthrough with screenshots). CQMsolution exports QRDA I XML files containing patient-level quality measure data. The documentation is process-oriented (how to run the export) rather than content-oriented (what data is exported). No data dictionary, field listing, or schema is provided — the vendor relies on the C-CDA and QRDA I standards as implicit format documentation. Notably absent is any documentation of how non-clinical data domains (billing, insurance, secure messages, appointments, audit trails) would be included in an 'all EHI' export, raising questions about completeness."
