Communication System Resources The PALTC Blog Health Resources Select Page PacEHR Electronic Health Information (EHI) All Data Export Welcome to Electronic Health Information (EHI) Export from PacEHR! This site describes the Electronic Health Information (EHI) Export capability provided in Saisystems PacEHR. Electronic health information (EHI) export is a feature of PacEHR that allows end users of the structured electronic health information to move or share patient&#8217;s information. This page describes what EHI records are available, common use cases of export, and the types of EHI exports offered for consumers of the structured electronic health information, who can be customers of Saisystem or other authorized entities such as auditing firms, EHR conversion vendors. Electronic Health Information (EHI)  EHI focuses on a set of health information that HIPAA covered entities and business associates currently collect, maintain, and make available for access, exchange, and use. For example, EHI is a subset of the same information in a HIPAA Designated Record Set, which may include: Medical records and billing records about individuals Enrollment, payment, claims adjudication, and case or medical management record systems maintained by or for a health plan.  Data used in whole or in part to make decisions about individuals.  Note: Regulators have excluded certain information from the definition of EHI, such as psychotherapy notes. EHI Export Use Cases Bulk EHI export enables export of all patient data belonging to a practice, provider, medical group, or department. This provision to export all EHI will enable providers or departments to have access to their total population. Single/multi-patient export is useful when patients request their health information or when their information is shared for referrals or authorized auditing purposes.

“APIs”). By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the terms below. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict. Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines as the “Terms.” You agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms carefully. If you use the APIs as an interface to, or in conjunction with other Saisystems’ products or services, then the terms for those other products or services also apply.\nUnder the Terms, “SSD” means Saisystems Digital LLC, with offices at 5 Research Drive,  Shelton CT.   Unless set forth otherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to “SSD” as “we”, “our”, or “us” in the Terms.\nSection 1: Account and Registration\na. Accepting the Terms\nYou may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with SSD, or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs.\nb. Entity Level Acceptance\nIf you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to “you” in the Terms refer to that entity).\nc. Registration\nIn order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. Any registration information you give to SSD will always be accurate and up to date and you’ll inform us promptly of any updates.\nd. Subsidiaries and Affiliates\nSSD has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world. These companies may provide the APIs to you on behalf of SSD and the Terms will also govern your relationship with these companies.\nSection 2: Using Our APIs\na. Your End Users\nYou will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Terms.\nb. Compliance with Law, Third Party Rights, and Other SSD Terms of Service\nYou will comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws). You will not use the APIs to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights. You will not violate any other terms of service with SSD (or its affiliates).\nc. Permitted Access\nYou will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If SSD assigns you developer credentials (e.g. client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client’s identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.\nd. API Limitations\nSSD sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API. If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain SSD’s express consent (and SSD may decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use). To seek such approval, contact the relevant SSD API team for information (e.g. by using the SSD developers console).\ne. Open Source Software\nSome of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with SSD for the applicable open source software.\nf. Communication with SSD\nWe may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the APIs. Please review the applicable API documentation for information about opting out of certain types of communication.\ng. Feedback\nIf you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.\nh. Non-Exclusivity\nThe Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that SSD may develop products or services that may compete with the API Clients or any other products or services.\nSection 3: Your API Clients\na. API Clients and Monitoring\nThe APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications (“API Client(s)”). YOU AGREE THAT SSD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE SSD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include SSD accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect SSD or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. SSD may use any technical means to overcome such interference. SSD may suspend access to the APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.\nb. Security\nYou will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personally identifiable information (“PII”), from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.\nc. Ownership\nSSD does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.\nd. User Privacy and API Clients\nYou will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to PII. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with SSD and third parties.\nSection 4: Prohibitions and Confidentiality\na. API Prohibitions\nWhen using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):\nSublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.\nPerform an action with the intent of introducing to SSD products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.\nDefame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.\nInterfere with or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.\nPromote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.\nReverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.\nUse the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).\nUse the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.\nRemove, obscure, or alter any SSD terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.\nSSD has obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (“HIPAA”), and makes every effort to ensure that the APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a “covered entity” or “business associate” as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to SSD unless you have received prior written consent to such use from SSD.\nb. Confidential Matters\nDeveloper credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.\nOur communications to you and our APIs may contain SSD confidential information. SSD confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without SSD’s prior written consent. SSD confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose SSD confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.\nSection 5: Content\na. Content Accessible Through our APIs\nOur APIs contain some third party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.\nb. Submission of Content\nSome of our APIs allow the submission of content. SSD does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling SSD to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable SSD privacy policies, you give SSD a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. “Use” means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.\nc. Retrieval of content\nWhen a user’s non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or to third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.\nd. Prohibitions on Content\nUnless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not permit your end users or others acting on your behalf to, do the following with content returned from the APIs:\nScrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;\nCopy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display, or sublicense to any third party;\nMisrepresent the source or ownership; or\nRemove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material.\nSection 6: Brand Features; Attribution\na. Brand Features\n“Brand Features” is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party’s Brand Features. All use by you of SSD’s Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of SSD.\nb. Attribution\nYou agree to display any attribution(s) required by SSD as described in the documentation for the API. SSD hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display SSD’s Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs. You must only use the SSD Brand Features in accordance with the Terms and for the purpose of fulfilling your obligations under this Section. In using SSD’s Brand Features, you must follow the\nSSD Brand Features Use Guidelines\n. You understand and agree that SSD has the sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of SSD’s Brand Features are in accordance with the above requirements and guidelines.\nc. Publicity\nYou will not make any statement regarding your use of an API which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by SSD without SSD’s prior written approval.\nd. Promotional and Marketing Use\nIn the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and the associated SSD products, SSD may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.\nSection 7: Privacy and Copyright Protection\na. SSD Privacy Policies\nBy using our APIs, SSD may use submitted information in accordance with our\nprivacy policies\nb. SSD DMCA Policy\nWe provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but we can’t determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and SSD’s policy about responding to notices in our\nHelp Center\nSection 8: Termination\na. Termination\nYou may stop using our APIs at any time with or without notice. Further, if you want to terminate the Terms, you must provide SSD with prior written notice and upon termination, cease your use of the applicable APIs. SSD reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto for any reason and at any time without liability or other obligation to you.\nb. Your Obligations Post-Termination\nUpon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the SSD Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored content that was permitted by the cache header under Section 5. SSD may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.\nc. Surviving Provisions\nWhen the Terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to: Sections 4b, 5, 8, 9, and 10.\nSection 9: Liability for our APIs\na. WARRANTIES\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS, NEITHER SSD NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE APIS, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIS, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.

2022\n   380→Thank you for using Saisystems’ APIs, other developer services, and associated software (collectively, “APIs”). By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the terms below. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict. Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines as the “Terms.” You agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms carefully. If you use the APIs as an interface to, or in conjunction with other Saisystems’ products or services, then the terms for those other products or services also apply.\n   381→Under the Terms, “SSD” means Saisystems Digital LLC, with offices at 5 Research Drive,  Shelton CT.   Unless set forth otherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to “SSD” as “we”, “our”, or “us” in the Terms.\n   382→Section 1: Account and Registration\n   383→a. Accepting the Terms\n   384→You may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with SSD, or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs.\n   385→b. Entity Level Acceptance\n   386→If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to “you” in the Terms refer to that entity).\n   387→c. Registration\n   388→In order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. Any registration information you give to SSD will always be accurate and up to date and you’ll inform us promptly of any updates.\n   389→d. Subsidiaries and Affiliates\n   390→SSD has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world. These companies may provide the APIs to you on behalf of SSD and the Terms will also govern your relationship with these companies.\n   391→Section 2: Using Our APIs\n   392→a. Your End Users\n   393→You will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Terms.\n   394→b. Compliance with Law, Third Party Rights, and Other SSD Terms of Service\n   395→You will comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws). You will not use the APIs to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights. You will not violate any other terms of service with SSD (or its affiliates).\n   396→c. Permitted Access\n   397→You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If SSD assigns you developer credentials (e.g. client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client’s identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.\n   398→d. API Limitations\n   399→SSD sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API. If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain SSD’s express consent (and SSD may decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use). To seek such approval, contact the relevant SSD API team for information (e.g. by using the SSD developers console).\n   400→e. Open Source Software\n   401→Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with SSD for the applicable open source software.\n   402→f. Communication with SSD\n   403→We may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the APIs. Please review the applicable API documentation for information about opting out of certain types of communication.\n   404→g.

You acknowledge that SSD may develop products or services that may compete with the API Clients or any other products or services.\n   408→Section 3: Your API Clients\n   409→a. API Clients and Monitoring\n   410→The APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications (“API Client(s)”). YOU AGREE THAT SSD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE SSD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include SSD accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect SSD or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. SSD may use any technical means to overcome such interference. SSD may suspend access to the APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.\n   411→b. Security\n   412→You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personally identifiable information (“PII”), from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.\n   413→c. Ownership\n   414→SSD does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.\n   415→d. User Privacy and API Clients\n   416→You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to PII. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with SSD and third parties.\n   417→Section 4: Prohibitions and Confidentiality\n   418→a. API Prohibitions\n   419→When using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):\n   420→Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.\n   421→Perform an action with the intent of introducing to SSD products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.\n   422→Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.\n   423→Interfere with or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.\n   424→Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.\n   425→Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.\n   426→Use the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).\n   427→Use the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.\n   428→Remove, obscure, or alter any SSD terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.\n   429→SSD has obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (“HIPAA”), and makes every effort to ensure that the APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a “covered entity” or “business associate” as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to SSD unless you have received prior written consent to such use from SSD.\n   430→b. Confidential Matters\n   431→Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.\n   432→Our communications to you and our APIs may contain SSD confidential information. SSD confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without SSD’s prior written consent. SSD confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose SSD confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.\n   433→Section 5: Content\n   434→a. Content Accessible Through our APIs\n   435→Our APIs contain some third party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.\n   436→b. Submission of Content\n   437→Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. SSD does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling SSD to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable SSD privacy policies, you give SSD a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. “Use” means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.\n   438→c. Retrieval of content\n   439→When a user’s non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or to third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.\n   440→d.

Attribution\n   450→You agree to display any attribution(s) required by SSD as described in the documentation for the API. SSD hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display SSD’s Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs.

SSD Privacy Policies\n   459→By using our APIs, SSD may use submitted information in accordance with our\n   460→privacy policies\n   461→b. SSD DMCA Policy\n   462→We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but we can’t determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and SSD’s policy about responding to notices in our\n   463→Help Center\n   464→Section 8: Termination\n   465→a. Termination\n   466→You may stop using our APIs at any time with or without notice. Further, if you want to terminate the Terms, you must provide SSD with prior written notice and upon termination, cease your use of the applicable APIs. SSD reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto for any reason and at any time without liability or other obligation to you.\n   467→b. Your Obligations Post-Termination\n   468→Upon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the SSD Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored content that was permitted by the cache header under Section 5.

WE PROVIDE THE APIS “AS IS”.\n   474→SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.\n   475→b. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n   476→TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING\n   477→OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICES OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE\n   478→DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.\n   479→c. Indemnification\n   480→You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and\n   481→assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Use or your use\n   482→of the Services, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Service content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use or your use of any information obtained from the Services.\n   483→Section 10: General Provisions\n   484→a.

We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and SSD does not take action right away, this does not mean that SSD is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and SSD relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.

“APIs”). By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the terms below. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict. Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines as the “Terms.” You agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms carefully. If you use the APIs as an interface to, or in conjunction with other Saisystems’ products or services, then the terms for those other products or services also apply.\nUnder the Terms, “SSD” means Saisystems Digital LLC, with offices at 5 Research Drive,  Shelton CT.   Unless set forth otherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to “SSD” as “we”, “our”, or “us” in the Terms.\nSection 1: Account and Registration\na. Accepting the Terms\nYou may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with SSD, or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs.\nb. Entity Level Acceptance\nIf you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to “you” in the Terms refer to that entity).\nc. Registration\nIn order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. Any registration information you give to SSD will always be accurate and up to date and you’ll inform us promptly of any updates.\nd. Subsidiaries and Affiliates\nSSD has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world. These companies may provide the APIs to you on behalf of SSD and the Terms will also govern your relationship with these companies.\nSection 2: Using Our APIs\na. Your End Users\nYou will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Terms.\nb. Compliance with Law, Third Party Rights, and Other SSD Terms of Service\nYou will comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws). You will not use the APIs to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights. You will not violate any other terms of service with SSD (or its affiliates).\nc. Permitted Access\nYou will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If SSD assigns you developer credentials (e.g. client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client’s identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.\nd. API Limitations\nSSD sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API. If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain SSD’s express consent (and SSD may decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use). To seek such approval, contact the relevant SSD API team for information (e.g. by using the SSD developers console).\ne. Open Source Software\nSome of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with SSD for the applicable open source software.\nf. Communication with SSD\nWe may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the APIs.

It contains:\n\n1. **Drummond ONC Certification disclosure** — restating the certification details\n2. **A link to the Compliance Certificate PDF** hosted on HubSpot: `Compliance Certificate PacEHR v20 010325.pdf`\n3. **FHIR API documentation** — \"FHIR Server 1.0.0 for Cures Act Update\" — covering 16 standard FHIR resources:\n   - AllergyIntolerance\n   - CarePlan\n   - CareTeam\n   - Condition\n   - Device\n   - DocumentReference (CCDA)\n   - Encounter\n   - Goal\n   - Immunization\n   - Location\n   - Medication / MedicationRequest\n   - Observation (labs, vitals, smoking status)\n   - Patient (demographics including USCDI v1/v2 elements)\n   - Practitioner\n   - Procedure\n4. **API Terms of Service** — standard boilerplate terms\n\nThe FHIR resources documented are standard US Core / USCDI resources.

No additional EHI export documentation.\n\n### Step 6: Browser verification\nNavigated to both pages in Chrome. The main EHI page renders as a simple WordPress page with the text content described above. The cures-update page renders with the FHIR API documentation in a long-form layout with tables for each resource endpoint. Screenshots captured.\n\n## What Was Found\n\nThe EHI export documentation for PacEHR consists of a single web page (https://saisystems.com/health/pacehr-ehi/) that provides a high-level description of the EHI export capability. The page describes three things:\n\n1. **What EHI is**: The page explains EHI by referencing the HIPAA Designated Record Set, noting it includes medical records, billing records, enrollment/payment/claims data, and data used for decision-making.\n\n2. **Export use cases**: Two modes are described — bulk export (all patient data for a practice/provider/department) and single/multi-patient export (for patient requests or referrals).\n\n3. **Export format**: The export is described as being in \"machine readable XML formats\" and using \"PacEHR's APIs that foster interoperability.\"\n\nThe page then links to the FHIR API documentation at thesnfist.com/cures-update/, which documents a standard FHIR R3 (STU3) API covering 16 US Core resources.\n\n**Critically absent** from the documentation:\n- No data dictionary or field-level documentation\n- No list of what data tables, entities, or domains are included in the export\n- No schema files (XSD, JSON Schema, or otherwise)\n- No sample export files or examples\n- No screenshots of the export interface\n- No instructions for how to perform the export\n- No mapping between PacEHR's internal data model and the export format\n- No documentation of non-USCDI data (billing, scheduling, administrative, etc.)\n\n## Export Coverage Assessment\n\n### Data Domain Coverage\n\nThe EHI export page claims to export \"all patient data\" and references billing records, claims, and decision-making data in its definition of EHI. However, there is **no documentation whatsoever** of what specific data domains are actually included in the export. The only concrete technical documentation provided is the FHIR API, which covers standard USCDI clinical data:\n\n**Covered by the documented FHIR API (g)(10) scope):**\n- Allergies (AllergyIntolerance)\n- Problems/conditions (Condition)\n- Medications (Medication, MedicationRequest)\n- Immunizations (Immunization)\n- Lab results and vitals (Observation)\n- Procedures (Procedure)\n- Clinical notes/documents (DocumentReference with CCDA)\n- Care plans and goals (CarePlan, Goal)\n- Care teams (CareTeam)\n- Encounters (Encounter)\n- Patient demographics (Patient)\n- Implantable devices (Device)\n- Practitioners (Practitioner)\n- Locations (Location)\n\n**Not documented and likely missing from the export:**\n- **Billing and coding data** — PacEHR has integrated billing, charge capture (billEHR), and claims management. The product research identifies this as a core capability. No billing data appears in the FHIR API documentation.\n- **Scheduling/appointment data** — Listed as a PacEHR feature on review sites. Not documented.\n- **Clinical encounter notes in native format** — PacEHR's core value is template-driven encounter documentation with voice-to-text. The FHIR API only exposes DocumentReference/CCDA, which is a standardized summary, not the native encounter note structure.\n- **Document management data** — Listed as a feature. Not documented.\n- **Communication records** — SNFConnect messages, patient portal messages. Not documented.\n- **Practice/facility census data** — Patient census by facility is a core workflow feature. Not documented.\n- **Quality measure/MIPS reporting data** — Certified for (c)(1). Not documented in the export.\n- **Audit logs** — Required for (d) criteria. Not documented in the export.\n- **User/provider configuration** — Templates, macros, custom settings. Not documented.\n\n### The (b)(10) vs (g)(10) Problem\n\nThis is a textbook case of conflating (b)(10) with (g)(10). The EHI export page describes \"machine readable XML formats\" and points to the FHIR API documentation. The FHIR API documents only standard US Core resources — this is the (g)(10) standardized API, not a comprehensive EHI export.\n\nThe EHI page's own definition of EHI includes \"billing records,\" \"enrollment, payment, claims adjudication,\" and \"case or medical management record systems\" — none of which appear in the FHIR API documentation. The vendor's documentation contradicts itself: the EHI page promises comprehensive health information, but the only technical documentation provided covers a narrow clinical data subset.\n\nKey evidence that this is (g)(10) repackaged as (b)(10):\n- The documented resources are exactly the standard US Core / USCDI resource set\n- All HL7 documentation links point to FHIR STU3 standard resources\n- There is no mention of billing, scheduling, or administrative data in the technical documentation\n- The FHIR server is described as \"FHIR Server 1.0.0 for Cures Act Update\" — not as an EHI export tool\n- No documentation of data that doesn't map to standard FHIR resources\n\n### Export Format & Standards\n\nThe export is described as \"machine readable XML formats\" on the EHI page. The linked FHIR API documentation specifies `application/fhir+json` as the accepted format. This creates some confusion — the EHI page says XML, but the FHIR API says JSON. It's unclear if these refer to the same mechanism or different ones.\n\nIf the export is via the FHIR API, it uses FHIR R3 (STU3) with US Core profiles. The documented resources cover standard USCDI v1/v2 data classes. This is a recognized standard but only covers clinical data — it cannot represent PacEHR's billing, scheduling, or administrative data.\n\nThe format is appropriate for the clinical data it covers, but inappropriate as a comprehensive EHI export format for a product that also stores billing/coding data, scheduling, document management, and practice administration data.\n\n### Documentation Quality\n\nThe documentation is **extremely thin**. The main EHI export page is approximately 150 words of substantive content. It provides no:\n- Data dictionary\n- Field-level definitions\n- Data types or value sets\n- Worked examples or sample exports\n- Instructions for performing the export\n- Screenshots of the export interface\n\nThe FHIR API documentation on the cures-update page is more substantial but is standard (g)(10) API documentation, not (b)(10) export documentation. It lists endpoints, parameters, and USCDI data element mappings for each resource.\n\nA developer reading this documentation would know how to call the FHIR API to retrieve standard clinical data. They would have no idea how to obtain a complete export of all data PacEHR stores for a patient — billing codes, encounter templates, scheduling records, practice configuration, etc.\n\nThe documentation does not appear to be actively maintained. The API Terms of Service are dated December 23, 2022 (the certification date). The Real World Testing results are listed as \"Coming Soon\" on the certifications page.\n\n### Structure & Completeness\n\n- **Granularity**: The EHI-specific page has zero field-level documentation. The FHIR API page lists USCDI data elements mapped to FHIR resources and documents API endpoint parameters, but does not provide PacEHR-specific field mappings.\n- **Coded fields**: No value sets are documented beyond what's standard in US Core.\n- **Relationships**: No entity relationship documentation.\n- **Versioning**: No version history or change log for the export documentation.\n\nThis is among the thinnest EHI export documentation possible while still having a page at the registered URL. The vendor created an EHI landing page that describes the concept of EHI, pointed to their existing FHIR API as the export mechanism, and did not create any (b)(10)-specific documentation.\n\n## Access Summary\n- Final URL (after redirects): https://saisystems.com/health/pacehr-ehi/ (no redirect)\n- Status: found\n- Required browser: no (all content accessible via curl)\n- Navigation complexity: direct_link (main page) + one_click (FHIR API docs on separate domain)\n- Anti-bot issues: none\n\n## Obstacles & Dead Ends\n\nNo technical obstacles. The page loaded cleanly via curl and browser. No authentication required, no anti-bot protection, no JavaScript-dependent rendering.\n\nThe obstacle is substantive rather than technical: the registered EHI export URL contains almost no technical documentation. The export mechanism, data dictionary, and format specifications are simply not documented. The only linked technical resource is the FHIR API documentation, which is the (g)(10) standardized API, not a comprehensive (b)(10) export.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":428,"cache_read_input_tokens":58842,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":428},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"36167e8b-80df-4212-9c0d-21aa8a0ec33b","uuid":"49b1a735-86df-4573-b471-92754c59af55"}
