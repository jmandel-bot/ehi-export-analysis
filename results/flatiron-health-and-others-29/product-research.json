OncoTrials clinical research component was sold to Paradigm Health in Dec 2025.",

The data exported likely mirrors OncoEMR's data model since it depends on OncoEMR as underlying software. Key question: does this export cover the same scope as OncoEMR's own (b)(10) export, or is it a separate/different export for network-level data?",

  "notes": "Flatiron Health was acquired by Roche for $1.9B in 2018 and operates as an independent affiliate. OneOncology is a separate entity (practice network) that uses Flatiron technology — the developer listing 'Flatiron Health, OneOncology, LLC' reflects this joint arrangement. In Dec 2025, Paradigm Health acquired Flatiron's Clinical Research business (OncoTrials), narrowing Flatiron's focus to EHR, decision support, analytics, and RWE. The OncoCloud suite (OncoEMR + OncoBilling + OncoAnalytics + Flatiron Assist + CareSpace portal + OncoAir mobile) represents the full product footprint for EHI purposes."
