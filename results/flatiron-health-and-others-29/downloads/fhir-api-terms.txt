API Terms of Use

This Site

 

Flatiron Health, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”, or “Flatiron”) maintains https://flatiron.my.site.com/FHIR/s/  (the “Site”) as a means of providing access to various application programming interfaces (each, an “API” and, collectively, the “APIs”) for the purpose of facilitating the development of applications (collectively, the “API Client”) that have the ability to retrieve patient information stored in Flatiron’s cloud­based software (“Flatiron Software”), including OncoEMR®, Flatiron’s cloud­based electronic health record product. As used herein, the terms “you” and “your” mean any person who views, accesses and/or uses the APIs, or obtains any other information from the Site.

 

Acceptance of These Terms of Use

 

These API Terms of Use (hereinafter called these “Terms”) state the terms and conditions under which you may access and use the Site and the APIs, including all related specifications and other materials that may be made available on the Site for use in connection with the APIs (collectively with the APIs, the “Content”) only for the purpose of developing, testing, marketing, offering, and distributing products and services associated with the APIs, and not for any other purpose. By accessing and/or otherwise using this Site and the Content, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be legally bound by these Terms.

 

You may not use the APIs and you may not accept these Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Flatiron or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs. If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms and, by accepting these Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to “you” and “your” in these Terms refer to that entity). In connection with your use of the APIs, you shall not impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity, or misrepresent the origin of any information that you provide in connection with your use of this Site or the APIs.

 

Please read these Terms carefully. We reserve the right to amend these Terms at any time and from time to time by posting revised Terms on the Site. These Terms were last revised on the date indicated below. If you use the Site or the APIs after amended Terms have been posted, you will be deemed to have agreed to such amended Terms. You may want to periodically visit this page to view the most recent Terms.

 

Using Our APIs

 

Prohibitions: You agree that you will not view, use or exploit any API or any other Content in a manner that: (1) is inconsistent with these Terms or contravenes any limitations or specifications contained in any applicable Content; (2) violates any federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or order; or (3) could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Flatiron Software or interfere with any other party’s use of the APIs or Flatiron Software. Further, you shall not (x) reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any Flatiron Software, except to the extent this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law,

(y) offer the APIs for use by third parties; or (z) transmit, distribute, introduce or otherwise make available in any manner through the Site or the APIs any computer virus, keyloggers, spyware, worms, Trojan horses, timebombs or other malicious or harmful programming (collectively, “Malware”). We do not have an obligation to detect the presence of such Malware. If you download Content from the Site or interface with Flatiron Software, you do so at your own risk.

 

Fees:  Flatiron’s introductory Certified FHIR® API Pricing is posted here.  Flatiron charges fees in two situations: (1) For use cases that require an OncoEMR® end user to launch the SMART-on-FHIR® application directly from OncoEMR® (EHR Launch); and (2) For a “value-added services” package to any application developers seeking to enhance their FHIR® API offering when integrating with OncoEMR®.  If you elect to receive either EHR Launch or value-added services, then Flatiron will charge the fees described here pursuant to a separate Service Order contract. The terms for those Services Order contracts are posted here for EHR Launch and here for value-added services.  Flatiron reserves the right to (i) charge other fees for non-certified FHIR APIs and (ii) amend these fee Terms at any time and from time to time by posting revised Terms on the Site.  .

 

API Limits: We may i) set and enforce limits on your use of the APIs (such as limiting the number or the nature of API requests that you may make) for no longer than necessary to resolve any negative impacts caused by excessive application calls or (ii) limit the volume of responses returned in a single call to maintain optimal system performance. You agree that you will not, and will not attempt to, circumvent any such limitations applicable to each API.

 

Non­Exclusivity: Your permission to use the Site and the APIs is non­exclusive. You understand that Flatiron, as well as third parties who use the APIs, may develop products or services that compete with your API Client.

 

Feedback: If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs or any Flatiron Software, we may use such information without any obligation to you.

 

Additional API Usage Terms: The information published at https://flatiron.force.com/FHIR/s/    outlines the API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters and their data types as well as the return variables and their types/structures. Regarding exceptions and exception handling methods and their returns, our APIs follow standard RESTful practices where any input exceptions will return HTTP 4XX STATUS error. Any server­side vendor caused exceptions will return HTTP 5XX STATUS.

 

No software components and configurations  beyond the standard RESTful implementation guidelines and usage are needed to be able to successfully interact with the API and process its response(s).

You shall ensure that your API Client operates in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and you shall require that users of your API Client comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
