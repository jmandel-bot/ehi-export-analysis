## Overview

DOX EMR is a small, niche EHR vendor headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, focused exclusively on podiatry. The company was founded in 2002 by Dr. Bart Ripperger, DPM, a foot and ankle surgeon who operates three practices in Arizona. He created DOX EMR after "wrestling with the growing administrative problems and rising costs of private practice for almost a decade." The company operates under two related brands: **DOX** is the EMR product, and **Starwriter** is a medical data collection component. The company tagline on its website is "DOX EMR / Starwriter Medical Data Collection."

Dr. Ripperger also runs a separate venture, Starwriter Research Solutions (drbartssolutions.com), which leverages the structured clinical data collected through the DOX EMR for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), real-world evidence (RWE), and decentralized clinical trials. This dual-purpose model — EMR for clinical use plus structured data collection for research — is a distinctive aspect of the company.

DOX EMR is a very small company. It is not listed among major podiatry EMR market players in industry reports (which name AdvancedMD, DrChrono, athenahealth, Kareo, Compulink, etc.). The company has only a handful of staff visible on ZoomInfo, including a Sales & Marketing Director and a Sales and Implementation and Training Specialist. Review volume across platforms is minimal (5 reviews on SoftwareFinder, 0 on EMRFinder, a handful on Capterra/SoftwareAdvice), suggesting a small installed base. There is no public information about number of customers or sites.

### What It Is

DOX EMR is a cloud-based, specialty-specific electronic medical records and practice management system designed exclusively for podiatry practices. It is marketed as requiring "no templates to build and no customization required — ready to use day one," featuring a pre-built podiatry-specific medical database that covers "all location, diagnosis, treatment, and plan options for conditions below the knee." The certified product (version 5.2, certified 2022-01-31) is a single integrated platform combining EMR, practice management, and billing — not a modular system with separately sold components.

The SED (Safety-Enhanced Design) intended user description is "Physician and Podiatrist," confirming this is a physician-facing ambulatory EMR for podiatric medicine.

The product has a broad ONC certification covering clinical documentation (a)(1)-(a)(5), (a)(12), (a)(14); transitions of care (b)(1); clinical quality measures (c)(1)-(c)(3); FHIR API access (g)(7)-(g)(10); direct messaging (h)(1); and the EHI export requirement (b)(10). This indicates a full-featured clinical system, not just a limited documentation tool.

### Users & Market

The primary users are podiatrists and their office staff. The system is described as suitable for podiatry practices "of all sizes, from small clinics to enterprise-level organizations" in settings including "hospitals, clinics, emergency centers, surgical centers, and nursing homes" (per SoftwareFinder). In practice, given the company's small size, it likely serves mainly small to mid-size ambulatory podiatry practices.

No specific customer counts, notable deployments, or case studies are publicly available. The company does not appear in major market share analyses of podiatry EMR software.

### Modules & Functionality

Based on the vendor website and third-party review sites, DOX EMR includes the following integrated modules and capabilities:

**Front Office / Scheduling**
- Appointment scheduling with a visual interface
- Automated appointment reminders to reduce no-shows
- Patient demographics and insurance management
- Overbooking prevention

**EMR / Clinical Documentation**
- Podiatry-specific medical database with pre-built content for diagnoses, treatments, and plans for conditions below the knee
- Patient charting with customizable templates aligned to podiatric needs
- Patient assessments, diagnoses, and treatment plans
- Medical history display (histories, medications, allergies displayed in "DOX PA")
- Patient dictation capability for clinical notes
- Graphical user interface for clinical documentation
- Real-time data capture

**E-Prescribing / Orders**
- Autogenerated orders and prescriptions from clinical documentation
- Ability to request diagnostic tests, procedures, and referrals directly through the system
- The (a)(4) certification for drug-drug/drug-allergy interaction checking confirms e-prescribing capability

**Patient Portal**
- Online patient portal where patients can:
  - Complete medical histories online (which then appear in the EMR)
  - Access their medical history
  - View upcoming appointments
  - View treatment plans
  - Access lab results
- The (e)(1) criterion is NOT in their certification, which is unusual — but the vendor materials consistently describe a patient portal

**Billing & Revenue Cycle Management**
- Integrated medical billing
- Automatic extraction of CPT and ICD billing codes from patient medical records
- Invoice creation and payment monitoring
- Insurance claim management (electronic claims submission)
- Revenue cycle management
- HL7 integration with external billing services (CoveMD mentioned as an example)
- Real-time data capture linked to billing

**Clinical Quality Measures**
- Meaningful Use / MIPS attestation support
- Clinical quality measure calculation and reporting (certified for (c)(1)-(c)(3))

**Interoperability**
- FHIR API access (certified for (g)(7)-(g)(10))
- Direct messaging (certified for (h)(1))
- Transitions of care / care summaries (certified for (b)(1))

**Platform**
- Cloud-based / web-based
- Multi-platform: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android
- Mobile access for viewing patient records remotely

### Data & Content

Based on the features described across vendor materials and review sites, DOX EMR stores:

- **Patient demographics and insurance information** — managed in the front office module
- **Medical histories** — entered by patients via the portal and displayed in the EMR
- **Medications and allergies** — displayed alongside patient histories
- **Clinical encounter notes / chart notes** — podiatry-specific assessments, diagnoses, treatment plans
- **Orders and prescriptions** — autogenerated from clinical documentation
- **Diagnostic test orders** — procedures, referrals, labs, x-rays (the clinical module mentions treatments "including office visit, x-ray, labs, procedures")
- **Lab results** — accessible through the patient portal, implying they are stored in the system
- **Billing data** — CPT codes, ICD codes, claims, invoices, payments
- **Appointment/scheduling data** — patient appointments, reminders
- **Clinical quality measure data** — for Meaningful Use/MIPS reporting
- **Care summaries / transition of care documents** — per (b)(1) certification

**What's unclear or not mentioned:**
- **Imaging/radiology data**: While "x-ray" is mentioned as a treatment type, it's unclear whether the system stores actual images or just orders/references
- **Scanned documents / attachments**: No mention of document management or scanning capability
- **Secure messaging between provider and patient**: The portal is described but messaging features are not explicitly called out
- **Fax management**: Not mentioned
- **Referral tracking details**: Referrals can be generated, but tracking and management details are not described
- **Orthotics management**: SoftwareFinder mentions "treatment planning and intervention tools" including orthotics, but details are sparse

**Research data angle**: The Starwriter component of the business suggests that clinical data is structured in a way that supports secondary use for research (HEOR, RWE). Dr. Ripperger describes a "patented process of clinical data collection" designed to produce "clean, structured data." This implies the EMR may capture more structured/coded data than a typical small podiatry EMR, though the specific data elements are not publicly documented.

### User Experience (from reviews)

Reviews are mixed (2.4/5 on SoftwareFinder from 5 reviews). Positive feedback notes the podiatry-specific design: "Not many specific Podiatry EMR's as easy as this one." Negative feedback reports performance issues (slow, freezing, random logouts), poor customer service, and billing integration difficulties — one review noted "billing companies have pleaded with practices to switch to another EMR."

## Research Gaps

- The DOX EMR website is built on Wix and renders poorly for automated content extraction — most pages returned only framework code, not actual content. The information above is primarily from third-party review/comparison sites and search snippets.
- No information was found about the total number of customers or installations.
- The old company website (doxpod.net) is no longer accessible (connection refused).
- Detailed feature documentation, user manuals, or technical specifications are not publicly available.
- The relationship between DOX EMR and the Starwriter research data business is described at a high level but the specifics of what additional data collection occurs are not clear from public sources.
