## Overview

Abeo Solutions, Inc is a small software company based in Austin, Texas, founded in 2001 (some sources say 2009), that develops **Crystal Practice Management** (also branded as "Crystal PM" or "CrystalPM") — an office management software suite specifically designed for optometrists and ophthalmologists. The company operates under multiple DBAs including "Opto" and "Crystal Practice Management." The corporate family includes **Abeo Billing, LLC** (revenue cycle management services) and **Schedule Your Exam, LLC** (online scheduling). The company is very small — estimated at 12–35 employees depending on the source, with approximately $5M in revenue. They market themselves as "#1 Most Trusted in Eye Care" and emphasize being "simple, fast, inexpensive and effective."

Crystal PM targets independent and multi-location optometry/ophthalmology practices. It is available in both on-premise ("in-office lease") and cloud-hosted deployment options. The product is certified by Drummond Group as an ONC-ACB. The company exhibits at Vision Expo, suggesting a focused presence in the optical industry.

## Product: Crystal Practice Management

CHPL ID: 10996

### What It Is

Crystal Practice Management is an all-in-one practice management and EHR platform purpose-built for eye care practices (optometry and ophthalmology). It is not a component of a larger system — it **is** the entire product. The certified module covers the full scope of the product. The system integrates scheduling, clinical documentation (EHR), billing/claims, optical inventory management, patient engagement, and e-prescribing into a single platform.

The product has a broad ONC certification profile: (a)(1)–(a)(5), (a)(12), (a)(14) for clinical capabilities; (b)(1)–(b)(2), (b)(10)–(b)(11) for care transitions and EHI export; (c)(1)–(c)(3) for clinical quality measures; (e)(1), (e)(3) for patient portal/VDT; (f)(1) for immunization reporting; (g)(2)–(g)(10) for API/FHIR access; and (h)(1) for direct messaging. This is a comprehensive certification footprint for a small vendor.

### Users & Market

**Target users**: Optometric practitioners and support personnel (per the CHPL SED description, which literally reads "Optometric Practitioners and Supprt Personnel"). In practice, this includes optometrists, ophthalmologists, optical technicians, billing staff, front desk/scheduling staff, and practice managers.

**Settings**: Independent optometry practices, multi-doctor eye care offices, and multi-location groups. The product is designed for ambulatory eye care, not hospitals or inpatient settings.

**Market size**: Unknown precisely. The company is small (12–35 employees). Review platforms show a modest number of reviews (Capterra, Software Advice, SourceForge all have reviews). The company's PPP loan data from 2020 reported 35 employees. Crystal PM positions itself as a cost-effective option for smaller practices.

**User satisfaction**: Reviews average 4.2–4.5 stars across platforms. Users praise the customizability and scheduling/billing integration. Common complaints include an occasionally dated-looking interface, freezing/crashing issues reported by some users, and difficulties reaching customer service in recent years.

- No mention of referral management as a distinct feature
- Document/image management beyond ophthalmic equipment imports is not clearly described
