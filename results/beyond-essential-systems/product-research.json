ONC certification appears strategic for international credibility rather than US market entry. Codebase is fully public on GitHub with ~100+ database models. Target market is Pacific Island national health systems and humanitarian healthcare (MSF), not US providers."

Revenue from implementation services and support contracts ($165-$665/month/facility), not software licensing. Product is genuinely feature-rich and actively developed but serves global health/development sector. No G2 or KLAS listings. Open-source codebase enables definitive verification of data model against EHI export."
