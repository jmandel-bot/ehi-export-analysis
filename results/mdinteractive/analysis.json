      "product_context": {
        "description": "MDinteractive is NOT a full EHR. It is a CMS Qualified Registry and MIPS quality reporting platform that has operated as a CMS Qualified Registry since 2010. The product describes itself as 'the MIPS extension of your EHR' — a complement to an existing EHR, not a replacement. It helps providers report quality measure data to CMS for MIPS, ACO/APM, Primary Care First, and Making Care Primary programs. Data enters the system via manual entry, Excel template upload, or QRDA III file upload from a certified EHR. The product does not perform clinical documentation, order entry, e-prescribing, billing, scheduling, or any typical EHR functions. Its certification profile confirms this narrow scope: it is certified only for (b)(10) EHI export, (c)(1)-(c)(4) clinical quality measures, (d) security/privacy, and (g)(4)-(g)(5) quality management — with none of the (a) clinical criteria, no (e)(1) patient portal, and no (f) public health criteria. The product's entire stored data model consists of provider identifiers, basic patient demographics, and quality measure numerator/denominator data points tied to visit dates.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The export produces a single Excel file containing all patient data stored in the system. It supports both single-patient and bulk (all patients) export. The exported file contains exactly 13 fields in three sections: provider information (4 fields: name, NPI, TIN), patient demographics (6 fields: name, MI, DOB, gender, MRN), and quality action fields (3 fields: visit/procedure date, numerator action, denominator). This is effectively a native database export — the system's entire data model is flat enough to fit in a single spreadsheet. The export is proportionate to what the system actually stores, which is minimal compared to a full EHR.",

        "description": "The documentation is a 2-page PDF: a cover page and a single page listing the 13 exported fields grouped into three sections. There are no data type definitions, no value set documentation, no example data, no export procedure instructions, and no relationship documentation. The brevity is somewhat proportionate to the product's minimal data model, but even so, the documentation lacks basic details like date formats, gender code values, and how the export is triggered. Quality measure field descriptions simply reference the MIPS CQM specifications (linking to the 2022 measures page, which is now outdated).",

The product stores only provider identifiers, basic patient demographics (name, DOB, gender, MRN), and quality measure performance data (visit dates, numerator/denominator flags). The export covers all of this data — which is the entirety of what the system stores. There are no gaps relative to the product's actual data holdings because the product simply does not store clinical notes, billing data, insurance information, messages, documents, or most other EHI categories. The export is complete for what the system is, but what the system is turns out to be extremely narrow. The only potential gap is audit trail data, which the system likely logs internally but does not include in the export.",

        "Documentation is extremely brief (1 page of content) with no data type definitions, value formats, or export procedure instructions.",

  "notes": "This is an unusual case where the certified product is not an EHR at all but a quality reporting registry. The b(10) EHI export requirement is met in letter — the product exports all EHI it stores — but the product stores almost nothing that would traditionally be considered EHI. MDinteractive is certified for (c)(1)-(c)(4) clinical quality measures and (d) security criteria only, with none of the (a) clinical criteria that define a full EHR. The product is designed to receive quality measure data from existing EHRs (via QRDA files or manual entry) and submit it to CMS.
