        "description": "PERFORM+ Connect is a FHIR-based interoperability and API middleware platform, NOT an EHR. It is built by CitiusTech, Inc., a healthcare IT services and consulting company (~5,400+ employees, $960M Bain Capital investment) that primarily provides technology services to healthcare organizations. PERFORM+ Connect provides a FHIR R4 data repository (built on HAPI FHIR), FHIR APIs conforming to US Core, CARIN Blue Button, and Da Vinci implementation guides, and OAuth 2.0 identity/access management. Its primary market is healthcare payers/health plans needing CMS interoperability compliance (Patient Access API, Payer-to-Payer exchange), with secondary use by providers for Cures Act compliance. The product does not originate clinical data — it receives data from external EHRs, claims systems, and other source systems and re-exposes it via standardized FHIR APIs. It has no patient portal, no clinical charting, no billing system, and no scheduling system of its own. The certified criteria are narrow: b(10), g(10), g(7), g(4), g(5), and d-series security criteria. No clinical quality measures (a-series) are certified. PERFORM+ Connect is one component of CitiusTech's PERFORM+ product suite, which also includes RealSight (price transparency), Contracts (value-based care), Stars (quality ratings), DataScale (analytics), and Regulatory (compliance reporting).",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "The EHI export uses FHIR Bulk Data Export — the standard Bulk Data Access API specification. Section 3.4 'EHI Export for 170.315(b)(10)' describes the same mechanism as Section 3.3 'Bulk FHIR Export,' with identical endpoints, parameters, and NDJSON output format. The export supports patient-level and group-level export, with _type, _since, _typeFilter, and _outputFormat parameters. Output is FHIR R4 NDJSON files, one per resource type. Because the product is a FHIR repository (not a native database), the export is inherently FHIR-shaped — there is no 'native database dump' option. The scope of exported data depends entirely on what FHIR resources have been loaded into the repository by the deploying organization's data integration pipelines.",

It covers 37 FHIR resource types, each with mandatory/must-support elements, search parameters, API request/response examples, and response element tables. The b(10) EHI export section is only 7 pages (pp. 27-34) and is essentially a duplicate of the Bulk FHIR Export section (pp. 16-26). Documentation provides field-level detail for FHIR resource elements (name, type, description) but no data type specifications beyond FHIR types, no value set enumerations beyond a few examples, and no relationship documentation beyond FHIR resource references. The document references external JSON response files but these are embedded as screenshot icons and not separately downloadable. The document is marked 'Client Confidential' on every page. It references US Core, CARIN Blue Button, and Da Vinci Implementation Guides but does not document deviations or extensions.",

        "overall_assessment": "This is a FHIR interoperability platform, not an EHR, so assessing 'EHI coverage' requires understanding that the platform's data content depends on what external systems feed into it. The 37 documented FHIR resource types provide good coverage of standard FHIR clinical and payer data categories. The export is particularly strong on payer-side data (EOBs across inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and professional settings; Coverage; Claims; InsurancePlan). Clinical data coverage follows standard US Core profiles. However, the export is limited to what FHIR R4 can represent — there is no mechanism to export data that doesn't fit FHIR resource definitions. Since the product doesn't originate data and has no patient portal, messaging, or native billing, the absence of those categories from the export is expected and not a gap per se. The key concern is that the b(10) export is identical to the Bulk Data API export — it adds nothing beyond FHIR API access, which may not constitute a meaningful file-based export of 'all EHI.'",

        "The b(10) EHI export section (3.4) is functionally identical to the Bulk FHIR Export section (3.3) — same endpoints, parameters, and output format. The EHI export appears to be the Bulk Data API relabeled, adding no additional data coverage beyond what the FHIR API already provides.",
        "The product is a FHIR interoperability middleware platform, not an EHR. The scope of 'all EHI that can be stored' depends entirely on what FHIR resources are loaded by the deploying organization, not on inherent product capabilities. This makes the b(10) certification somewhat abstract.",
        "Every page is marked 'Client Confidential' — contradicting the ONC requirement that EHI export documentation be publicly accessible. The copyright notice states the document 'may not be reproduced or disclosed to any unauthorized person.'",
        "The document has not been updated since March 2023 (pre-certification), nearly 3 years old.",
        "No dedicated data dictionary or export-specific documentation. The EHI export is documented as 7 pages within a 114-page FHIR API reference.",
        "The export is limited to standard FHIR R4 resource types. Any data that doesn't fit FHIR resource definitions cannot be exported. Since the product is a FHIR repository, this is inherent rather than a design limitation."

The fundamental limitation is that the product is a pass-through — it can only export whatever FHIR data has been loaded into its repository by external systems."

  "summary": "CitiusTech's PERFORM+ Connect is a FHIR interoperability middleware platform — not an EHR — certified for b(10) EHI Export and g(10) Standardized API. The EHI export documentation is a 114-page FHIR API reference PDF with a 7-page section on b(10) that is functionally identical to the Bulk Data Export section. The export produces NDJSON files for 37 FHIR resource types, with particular strength in payer-side data (EOBs, Claims, Coverage). Since the product is a FHIR data repository that receives data from external systems, the actual EHI exported depends entirely on what has been loaded — the platform itself does not originate clinical or administrative data.",

  "notes": "The document is marked 'Client Confidential' on every page despite being hosted on a public, unauthenticated HubSpot URL. The product was certified by Drummond Group in April 2023 (certification number 15.04.04.2694.Perf.22.01.0.230426). CitiusTech is primarily a healthcare IT services company ($960M Bain Capital investment, ~5,400 employees) rather than a traditional EHR product vendor. The PERFORM+ Connect pricing uses Per Member Per Month (PMPM) model — characteristic of payer/health plan products. One interesting detail: page 14 mentions 'the date the allergy was recorded in Epic' — suggesting the product may have been initially built with Epic integration in mind, or the documentation was adapted from Epic-specific content."
