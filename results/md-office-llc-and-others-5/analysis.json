  "product_context": {
    "description": "Sightview EHR Holdings is a consolidator of ophthalmology and optometry EHR products. It operates six distinct software products (MDoffice, ManagementPlus, Medflow EHR, My Vision Express, iMedicWare, and myCare Portal) plus a cross-product Regulatory Compliance Platform. These were originally developed by separate companies that were acquired and unified under the Sightview brand. The products are purpose-built for eye care practices — ophthalmology, optometry, and optical retail — and include specialty-specific features like ophthalmic imaging (OCT, visual fields, fundus photography, A-scan biometry), contact lens fitting, refraction data, and glasses prescriptions. The broader Sightview platform advertises Practice Management (scheduling, billing), Revenue Cycle Management (claims, authorizations, remittances, collections), Optical retail management (frame/lens inventory, sales, lab orders), Patient Engagement (voice, email, two-way text messaging), Ambulatory Surgery Center management, MIPS reporting, and Integrated Payments. The myCare Portal is the patient-facing portal component. The certified modules are the individual EHR products; the broader product is the full Sightview practice management and EHR platform with optical retail, RCM, and patient engagement capabilities.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Each product exports EHI as a ZIP file containing two sub-archives: 'ehi_structured_file' (discrete data as CSV files organized into folders) and 'ehi_unstructured_file' (documents and images). The structured export is organized into logical folders: Administration, Clinical, Clinical Notes, Diagnostic Imaging, Encounters, Observations and Orders, Ophthalmic Data, and (for most products) Communications. Each folder contains one or more CSV files with documented column names and descriptions. This is a native database export approach — the CSV files map closely to the system's internal data structures rather than being projected through FHIR or C-CDA. The ophthalmic imaging CSVs contain file paths referencing the unstructured files. Four of five products (ManagementPlus, Medflow, My Vision Express, iMedicWare) share an identical export structure with ~68 CSV files. MDoffice has a simpler structure with ~50 CSV files and notably lacks the Communications (messaging) folder.",

  "documentation_quality": {
    "description": "The documentation is thorough for a specialty EHR vendor. Each product has its own PDF data dictionary (49-62 pages) documenting every CSV file: file name, column names, and plain-English descriptions of each field. The documents include a table of contents, revision history, product information, legal notices, and step-by-step instructions for extracting the ZIP file. Field descriptions are clear and meaningful (e.g., 'This field contains the patient's AR sphere OD' rather than cryptic column names). Data types are not explicitly specified but are implied by descriptions. No sample data is provided. No foreign key relationships are documented, though PATIENT_ID appears as a consistent joining key across all tables. The five product documents were all created on the same day (Aug 2, 2024), suggesting a coordinated documentation effort during Sightview's consolidation. The ophthalmology-specific sections are particularly detailed, covering 15+ imaging modalities and multiple refraction/acuity measurement types.",

  "ehi_coverage": {
    "overall_assessment": "The export is strong on clinical and ophthalmology-specific data, with excellent coverage of ophthalmic imaging, refraction data, visual acuity, IOP, contact lens fittings, and glasses prescriptions. Administrative data coverage is reasonable — demographics, insurance, authorizations, referrals, and care team members are included. However, there are significant gaps in billing/financial detail and scheduling. The Encounter.csv includes CPT and ICD-10 codes but no dollar amounts, charges, payments, or claims data. No appointment/scheduling data exists — only follow-up orders. This is a major gap given that Sightview's platform prominently advertises Practice Management (scheduling) and Revenue Cycle Management (claims, billing). The optical retail/inventory data (frame sales, lens orders, point-of-sale transactions) advertised on the website is completely absent from the export. Four of five products include patient-provider messaging, but MDoffice does not. No audit trail data is included in any product. Overall, the export covers the EHR/clinical side well but largely omits the practice management, billing, optical retail, and RCM data that the broader platform stores.",
    "clinical": {
      "present": true,

Additionally extensive ophthalmology-specific data: 15+ diagnostic imaging types (OCT, VF, Fundus, HRT, Topography, Pachy, GDX, etc.), refraction data, autorefractor values, retinoscopy, IOP, contact lens exams, glasses prescriptions, visual acuity, dilation, EOM, color vision, slit lamp, and more."

MDoffice is the exception — it has no Communications section at all. The myCare Portal (patient portal) defers to the EHR for export, so portal messages would only be captured if the underlying EHR includes them."

    "billing_financial": {
      "present": false,
      "evidence": "No billing, charge, payment, or claims data is present in any product's export. The Encounter.csv includes CPT codes and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, and the insurance copay field appears in HealthInsurance.csv, but there are no tables for charges, claims, payments, adjustments, accounts receivable, transactions, or financial amounts. The authorization CPT code is in Authorizations.csv but without dollar amounts. This is a significant gap given that Sightview prominently advertises Practice Management billing, Revenue Cycle Management, integrated payments, and optical point-of-sale capabilities. All financial transaction data appears to be excluded from the export."

Prior_Authorizations.csv includes authorization details with insurance type, CPT code, authorized amount, dates, status. Referrals.csv includes referral provider, notes, dates. This provides reasonable insurance coverage data, though payer-specific benefits/eligibility detail is absent."

    "appointments_scheduling": {

      "evidence": "No appointment or scheduling tables exist in any product's export. The only scheduling-adjacent data is Follow_Up_Orders.csv (in four products, not MDoffice) which captures follow-up frequency, procedure, and physician — but these are clinical follow-up orders, not scheduling/appointment data. Given that Sightview advertises 'Integrated scheduling' and 'Practice Management' with appointment booking as a core feature, actual appointment data (date, time, status, provider, location, type, cancellations, no-shows) is conspicuously absent."

    "MDoffice lacks the Communications (messaging) section that the other four products include, creating an inconsistency across the product family.",
    "Optical retail data (frame inventory, lens sales, lab orders, point-of-sale transactions) advertised on Sightview's website is completely absent from all product exports.",
    "No audit trail data is included in any product's export.",
    "myCare Portal defers to the underlying EHR for EHI export, meaning portal-specific data may not be captured if the EHR's export doesn't include it.",
    "The EHI Extraction disclaimer includes unusual indemnification language requiring clients to indemnify Sightview for any privacy breaches resulting from the client's handling of exported data — this could discourage EHI export requests.",
    "No data types are documented for any fields across all product data dictionaries.",

  "summary": "Sightview EHR Holdings provides EHI export documentation for five ophthalmology/optometry EHR products as individual PDF data dictionaries. The exports use a native CSV-in-ZIP approach with strong clinical and ophthalmology-specific coverage (15+ imaging modalities, refraction, visual acuity, IOP). Four of five products include patient-provider messaging. However, there are major gaps: no billing/financial data (charges, claims, payments), no appointment/scheduling data, no optical retail/inventory data, and no audit trails — despite the broader Sightview platform prominently advertising practice management, RCM, optical retail, and scheduling capabilities. The export covers the clinical EHR well but omits practice management and financial data.",

  "notes": "All five product data dictionaries were created on the same day (August 2, 2024), suggesting a coordinated documentation effort during the Sightview consolidation. Four of the five products (ManagementPlus, Medflow, My Vision Express, iMedicWare) share an identical export structure, while MDoffice has a simpler and less complete structure. The myCare Portal patient portal does not have its own EHI export — it defers to whichever EHR product the practice uses. The Regulatory Compliance Platform is a cross-cutting module rather than a standalone EHR."
