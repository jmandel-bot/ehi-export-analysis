  "issues": [
    "No billing/financial data tables (charges, claims, payments) in any product's export — significant gap for ophthalmology practices",
    "No appointment/scheduling data exported",
    "No audit trail data exported",
    "MDoffice lacks the Communications section (patient/provider messages) that the other 4 products include",
    "Data types not specified in documentation — only column names and brief descriptions provided",
    "Regulatory Compliance Platform and myCare Portal do not have their own EHI export — they rely on the underlying EHR product"
  ],
  "summary": "Sightview EHR Holdings operates 5 ophthalmology/optometry EHR products (MDoffice, ManagementPlus, Medflow, My Vision Express, iMedicWare) plus a compliance platform and patient portal. Each EHR product has a dedicated PDF data dictionary (Version 2.0, ~50-68 pages) documenting a CSV-based export packaged as ZIP files (structured + unstructured). The export covers clinical data, demographics, insurance, diagnostic imaging (extensive ophthalmic tests), and secure messages (except MDoffice), but notably omits billing/financial data, appointment scheduling, and audit trails. Documentation provides field-level column names with descriptions but no explicit data types."
