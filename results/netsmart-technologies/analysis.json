  "product_context": {
    "description": "Netsmart Technologies is a major health IT vendor specializing in behavioral health, human services, and post-acute care. Their products operate under the CareFabric platform. The six certified products span very different use cases: myAvatar is the flagship behavioral health EHR with full billing (837P/I/D, 835 remittance, NCPDP pharmacy), deep scheduling, treatment plans, and clinical documentation for inpatient/outpatient behavioral health, IDD, foster care, and CCBHCs. myEvolv is a mid-market configurable behavioral health EHR for child & family services, IDD, and autism, with auto-claim generation from clinical notes. myUnity is a post-acute care EHR for home health, hospice, senior living, and skilled nursing with unified patient records across care settings. CarePathways Measures Reporting is a data warehouse that aggregates data from Netsmart EHRs for quality measures and population health analytics. TheraOffice is a physical/occupational/speech therapy practice management and EMR system with integrated billing and scheduling. myHealthPointe is the cross-product patient engagement portal providing secure messaging, appointment requests, lab results viewing, and telehealth integration. Additional cross-product capabilities include CareConnect Inbox (secure messaging between providers), RevConnect (clearinghouse/claims management), and dedicated RCM services. The products collectively store extensive clinical, billing, scheduling, messaging, and administrative data.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Netsmart provides separate EHI export documentation for each of its 6 certified products, reflecting their distinct architectures. The approach varies significantly by product: myAvatar uses native database table exports in delimited file format, covering 445 tables with extraordinarily deep billing, scheduling, and audit trail coverage — this is the gold standard among the Netsmart products. myEvolv exports JSON files organized by 'events' (clinical encounters/forms) and 'non-events' (demographics, configuration), with 1,679 event types and 250 non-event forms, plus base64-encoded attachments inline — clinically comprehensive but operationally limited. myUnity exports 24 distinct file types in JSON format covering a well-organized set of categories including claims, appointments, documents, and insurance. CarePathways exports 95 data warehouse tables (dim_* and fact_* format) queried via SQL — strong on analytics/measures data but reflecting its role as a reporting layer, not a primary EHR. TheraOffice exports 19 database tables focused on patient demographics and USCDI clinical data, with minimal billing detail. myHealthPointe exports only Subject Messages between patients and providers via a report tool — just 8 fields across 3 pages of documentation. Each product is a manual, one-time export that produces files per patient.",

CarePathways has a 97-page PDF documenting 95 data warehouse tables with SQL query examples. TheraOffice has a concise 30-page PDF documenting 19 tables with column names and data types. myHealthPointe has just 3 pages describing a report export of 8 message fields.

None provide sample data, value set documentation, or explicit foreign key relationships (though myAvatar's table naming conventions imply relationships).

It is among the most comprehensive EHI exports in the industry. myUnity is also strong with 24 file types covering claims, claim charges, adjustments, appointments, eligibility, authorizations, documents, attachments, and insurance. myEvolv is clinically deep (1,679 event types) but weak on billing (only face-sheet views of claims, not raw billing tables), scheduling (events2do table not exported), and audit trails (update_log table referenced but not exported). CarePathways covers measures/reporting data well but is a reporting layer, not a primary EHR — it has claims and appointments but lacks messages, audit trails, and documents. TheraOffice is notably thin — only 19 tables focused on USCDI clinical data, with minimal billing (just a few fields in PTCASE) and no messages, documents, or audit data, despite the product having full billing, scheduling, and patient portal capabilities. myHealthPointe covers only secure messages (8 fields). The biggest gap across the suite is secure messaging — myHealthPointe stores patient-provider messages but its EHI documentation is extremely minimal, and none of the other products include portal message data. CareConnect Inbox messages appear absent from all exports.",

CarePathways: fact_allergy, fact_diagnosis, fact_immunization, fact_medicationorder, fact_prescription, fact_vitalsign, fact_problem, fact_careplan, fact_laboratoryresult.

  "summary": "Netsmart Technologies provides separate EHI export documentation for each of its 6 certified products, with quality and coverage varying enormously. myAvatar is exceptional — 445 native database tables covering billing (114 tables), scheduling (34 tables), audit trails (46 tables), and comprehensive clinical data, placing it among the most thorough EHI exports in the industry. myUnity is also strong with 24 well-organized file types covering claims, appointments, insurance, documents, and clinical data. myEvolv is clinically deep (1,679 event types, 115K+ field definitions) but omits key operational tables for scheduling and audit. CarePathways provides solid reporting-layer coverage of 95 tables. TheraOffice is notably thin at 19 tables focused on USCDI clinical data, missing most of the billing, scheduling, and practice management data the product clearly stores. myHealthPointe is the weakest — just 3 pages covering portal message export with 8 fields. The biggest cross-product gap is secure messaging: despite Netsmart offering HIPAA-compliant messaging across its platform, message data is minimally represented in exports.",

  "notes": "The table_or_resource_count of 445 in documentation_quality reflects myAvatar specifically, as it is the largest product. Total unique data elements across all products: myAvatar 445 tables, myEvolv 1,679 events + 250 non-events, CarePathways 95 tables, myUnity 24 file types, TheraOffice 19 tables, myHealthPointe 8 fields. GEHRIMED (a 7th product not in our CHPL IDs) also has EHI documentation available. The myHealthPointe page explicitly states it delegates EHI export to the underlying EHR, treating itself as 'relied upon software' — so its message export supplements rather than replaces the EHR exports. myEvolv provides SQL queries that agencies can run to discover their own schema, including custom user-defined forms not in the standard crosswalk — a sophisticated self-service approach."
