  "issues": [
    "myHealthPointe uses 'relied upon software' for b(10) — its own documentation only covers secure messages (8 fields, 3 pages). This is effectively a stub.",
    "myAvatar documentation is dated September 2023 — nearly 2 years old at time of collection.",
    "TheraOffice has very limited scope: 19 tables, mostly USCDI-aligned. No billing, scheduling, or messaging tables. This suggests the export may be closer to USCDI/FHIR scope than true 'all EHI'.",
    "CarePathways uses an EDW (Enterprise Data Warehouse) schema with star/snowflake dimension/fact tables rather than operational tables — the export may not reflect the full operational database.",
    "Rich text documents and images are noted as 'not available in table format' but 'referenced in the extracts' — binary content handling is unclear.",
    "myAvatar ZIP href was missing leading slash in HTML — potential link breakage in some contexts."
  ],
  "summary": "Netsmart Technologies provides separate EHI export documentation for each of its 6+ certified products. Documentation quality and depth varies enormously: myAvatar has 445 tables across 7,492 pages with extensive billing/insurance/audit coverage; myEvolv provides the most developer-friendly package (XLSX crosswalk with 136K+ field mappings, companion guide, and SQL queries); myUnity documents 24 JSON export files with 366 fields; CarePathways covers 62 EDW tables; TheraOffice has 19 USCDI-aligned tables; and myHealthPointe is essentially a stub that delegates to other products. The exports use native formats (delimited files or JSON) rather than FHIR — this is genuine database-level EHI export. myAvatar's documentation stands out for its extraordinary depth in billing (100+ tables covering all X12 EDI transaction types) and audit trails (45+ audit tables)."
