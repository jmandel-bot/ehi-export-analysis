Interesting — very minimal certification. Only `(b)(10)` (EHI export) plus `(d)` criteria (security/privacy infrastructure) and `(g)(4)`/`(g)(5)` (quality management/accessibility). No clinical criteria, no patient portal, no FHIR APIs, no public health reporting. Let me research the vendor and product.

[RESULT: Subagent 'endosoft-research' response:
[Subagent is still working (timeout reached). Progress summary:]
**Summary:** The subagent has successfully navigated EndoSoft's website and extracted key information from the homepage, identifying EndoSoft as a maker of "AI-Driven Endoscopy EHR Software for Procedure Reporting & Image Capture" covering consent-to-discharge workflow, documentation, reporting, and image/video capture management. It discovered the site's navigation structure and found direct URLs for subpages (including `/qlinical/`, `/about-us/`, `/endovault/`). The subagent had just navigated to the `/qlinical/` page and captured its content but had not yet read/reported it, and still needs to visit several other requested URLs (qlinical.com, about-us, specialties pages, etc.). It is making steady progress but is roughly 30-40% complete with the research task.]

[RESULT: Subagent 'endosoft-research' response:
[Subagent is still working (timeout reached). Progress summary:]
The subagent has successfully scraped content from several key pages: endosoft.com homepage, /qlinical/, /about-us/, /endovault-ehr/, /certifications/, and qlinical.com homepage. It has collected detailed text content from each page including product features, company history (founded 1995 by Rakesh and Manish Madan), certifications, and product descriptions. The subagent was in the process of visiting qlinical.com/ephi/ and collecting link structures from qlinical.com when the timeout hit — it still needs to visit that ephi page and compile/report all findings back in a structured summary.]

[RESULT: Subagent 'endosoft-research' response:
[Subagent is still working (timeout reached). Progress summary:]
The subagent has successfully scraped content from multiple pages across endosoft.com (About Us, EndoVault EHR, Certifications, Locations, Argus AI) and qlinical.com (homepage, ePHI export page). It was in the process of gathering additional product details (e.g., Approvon page) and had not yet compiled all findings into a final summary report. The subagent is making good progress—it has collected substantial raw data from at least 7-8 pages but needs to consolidate everything into a coherent report; the parent agent should ask it to compile what it has and finish visiting any remaining critical pages.]

[TOOL: subagent]

}
[RESULT: Subagent 'endosoft-research' response:
[Subagent is still working (timeout reached). Progress summary:]
**Summary:** The subagent successfully visited and scraped content from 7+ pages across endosoft.com (About Us, EndoVault EHR, Certifications, Locations, Argus AI) and qlinical.com (homepage, ePHI export page), collecting substantial text content from each into JSON result files. However, it repeatedly kept navigating to new pages instead of compiling its findings, despite the user asking multiple times for a structured summary of what was already collected. The subagent never produced the final compiled report — it needs to be re-prompted to **stop browsing and simply synthesize the already-collected content** from the JSON result files stored in `/tmp/shelley-console-logs/` (files: `js_result_03733bca.json`, `js_result_4632f8ae.json`, `js_result_d5b4d921.json`, `js_result_df8cbb31.json`, `js_result_4e57f26a.json`, `js_result_4fb4b296.json`, `js_result_aed1411c.json`).]

That’s when EndoSoft® was born. Rakesh, with his team of developers and his brother’s insight, created a program that would capture images and save it to the computer, saving the expense of printing paper and time. From this cutting-edge capability in 1995, EndoSoft® has grown into the healthcare information technology and software company we know today. EndoSoft® is constantly developing programs to optimize clinicians’ workflows, inventory management, scheduling, and even green efforts!\n\nWith our wide base of ever-expanding installations at prestigious institutions throughout the United States and around the world, we have developed a leadership position and a reputation for technological excellence and quality.\n\nEndoSoft® is unique. Unlike most products on the market today, EndoSoft® is not merely a collection of applications bundled together; it is workflow technology that seamlessly integrates all aspects of the healthcare enterprise – clinical, administrative, and financial.\n\nOur goal at EndoSoft® is to develop solutions based on our customers’ needs. We are constantly developing innovations that are exciting, practical, and useful. The applications are designed to emulate the clinical thought processes of clinicians and nurses on the patient side and the workflow patterns of administrators and office staff for scheduling, patient encounters, financial chores, and resource management.\n\nFor today’s busy healthcare professional, working for pleasure has become a thing of the past due to heavy patient care loads, administrative/regulatory/financial chores, and the seemingly endless stream of paperwork. EndoSoft® applications have automated most of the non-clinical, manual chores and eliminated the repetitive, mundane tasks of procedure documentation and workflow management, allowing healthcare professionals to once again be excited about their core business – patient care!\n\nSign Up for Expert Insights and Industry Trends\nEmail Address*\nSubscribe\n\n135 Broadway\nSchenectady, NY 12305\n\nPhone: (518) 831-8000\nEmail: sales@endosoft.com\n\nSupport:\nPhone: 866-ENDOSOFT\nEmail: Support@endosoft.com\n\nOther Sites:\nwww.argusml.com\nwww.qlinical.com\n\n   \nPRODUCTS\nEndoVault® EHR\nQlinical®\nArgus® AI\nApprovon®\nSPECIALTIES\nOncology\nGastroenterology\nPulmonology\nPain Management\nGeneral Surgery\nOrthopedics\nOB/GYN\nOtolaryngology\nPathology\nUrology\nFeatures\nCOMPANY\nAbout Us\nLocations\nCertifications \u0026 Memberships\nCareers\nNews\nFAQs\nEvents\nPatents\nSitemap\nCONTACT US\nAccessibility Commitment\nPrivacy Policy\nMobile Privacy Policy\nSupport Policies \u0026 License Agreements\nModern Slavery Policy\nCarbon Reduction Plan\nSUPPORT\n© 2026 EndoSoft® | EHR \u0026 EMR Endoscopy Software | Multi-Specialty Procedure Documentation\nContact Us\nSupport"]

Once you learn our software, it is easy to be locked into a workflow that stays the same for a long time. We are hoping to help you unlock more features that you might not know about. Below is a detailed discussion on commonly missed features of our software that can add many benefits to your workflow.\n\nKeeping your software up to date is very important as it protects against bugs and vulnerabilities. Updates also give you access to the latest features and benefits to keep your practice running smoothly.\n\nClick Here To Read The Latest Release Notes\n\nApplication Customization\n\nEndoVault® offers many ways to customize your application to fit your needs. Customization can help you work more efficiently and save you time through procedures and documentation. Here are some examples:\n\n• Pick lists can be customized to different workflows\n• Fields on the procedure report can be added or removed depending on workflow\n• Screens and fields can be added or removed depending on provider workflows\n• Procedure report templates can be configured to the provider\n• Standardized templates at the facility or enterprise level\n• Database reports can be customized according to organization standards and preferences\n• Users and roles can be added or modified through admin accounts\n\nThese are just some ways that EndoVault® can be customized to provide better workflows for organizations and providers.\n\n\nES Reporting Tool\n\nThe Global Rating Scale (GRS) was created as a quality improvement and assessment tool for gastrointestinal endoscopy departments. The GRS enables endoscopy units to assess how well they provide patient-centered service and provides a standard for accreditation and a quality framework for service improvement.\n\nThe EndoSoft® GI Procedure Documentation application offers an integrated tool for ES reporting. The tool enables healthcare practitioners to easily extract and assemble their quality and safety outcomes based on GRS requirements and export the data into a file format (Excel and CSV) for submission.\n\n• Reports to monitor, measure \u0026 report quality of care\n• Calculate \u0026 export reports on polyp detection rates, adequacy of bowel prep, adenoma detection rate, withdrawal time, cecal intubation rate, \u0026 more\n• Develop custom reports or use over 150 pre-built reports\n• Create pie charts \u0026 bar graphs to illustrate statistical \u0026 key data elements\n• Fully integrated, HL7 compliant \u0026 fully customizable\n\nInterface Notifications\n\nInterfaces via HL7 can add a great deal of value to your practice when working between EndoVault® and an EHR system for patient information. Typically, this interoperability works without issue; however, there may be times when a data transmission fails. EndoSoft® can set up email notifications to alert when any outbound transfers between interfaces fail. With this setup, you can avoid any interruption to your workflow.\n\nEmail notifications for undelivered transfers sent back to EHR/EMRs can be sent to any number of people in your organization.\n\nDowntime Mode\n\nDowntime mode is a feature of EndoVault® which allows for use of your software when your network is offline. Typically, EndoVault® would be connected to your database through an internet connection. If your network connection is lost, our software has the ability to save your input data in a local database until a connection is reestablished. Once the connection to the main database is restored, EndoVault® will send the data stored in the local database as if it was there at the time of recording.\n\n• Can be enabled and disabled\n• Allows you to continue operating when your network is offline\n\nElectronic Nursing Record®\n\nEndoVault ENR® turns data into documentation with ease. From patient history to procedure reports to vital sign monitoring and scheduling, EndoVault® streamlines workflow and increases efficiency. Interface directly with your EHR to create your most complete documentation. For a multi-disciplinary approach to documentation and image management. Eliminate the need for duplicate documentation, information flows easily and fills all required fields simultaneously. Integration with point of care devices reduces errors and saves time by automatically collecting vital sign information.\n\nAutomatic vital sign recording\nPatient tracking\nInventory management\nComplete EHR\nTime \u0026 material billing\nMedical reconciliation\n\nClick To Learn More About ENR®\n\n\nEndoSoft® Integrations\n\nIf your system uses an electronic health record or hospital information system for patient records, EndoVault® has the ability to integrate with all those systems, eliminating errors and duplication of effort. Complete integrations via HL7 or FHIR can result in saving time, labor and resources.\n\n \n\nArgus® Artificial Intelligence\n\nArgus® is AI powered by EndoSoft®, with natural language processing for endoscopy documentation, and our newest AI software, MedGPT™, a generative chart review platform.\n\nOur intelligent report writer allows clinicians to save additional time by completing documentation during the actual procedure, using only their voice. Quality metrics are also documented automatically as part of the report process. Natural language processing enables documentation to be more descriptive over traditional point and click methods.\n\nThe days of sifting through patient charts is over. MedGPT™ allows clinicians to quickly review patient charts faster than ever before. Have answers available to predefined or prompted questions about a patient and retrieve additional information on demand.\n\nClick To Learn More About Argus®\n\nLooking to Add Additional Features?\n\nIf you would like to upgrade your version of EndoVault® or add additional features, please contact your sales rep or fill out the contact form below.\n\nContact\n\nCompany Name*\nFirst Name*\nLast Name*\nEmail Address*\nCountry*\nUSA (+1)\nUK (+44)\nAlgeria (+213)\nAndorra (+376)\nAngola (+244)\nAnguilla (+1264)\nAntigua \u0026 Barbuda (+1268)\nArgentina (+54)\nArmenia (+374)\nAruba (+297)\nAustralia (+61)\nAustria (+43)\nAzerbaijan (+994)\nBahamas (+1242)\nBahrain (+973)\nBangladesh (+880)\nBarbados (+1246)\nBelarus (+375)\nBelgium (+32)\nBelize (+501)\nBenin (+229)\nBermuda (+1441)\nBhutan (+975)\nBolivia (+591)\nBosnia Herzegovina (+387)\nBotswana (+267)\nBrazil (+55)\nBrunei (+673)\nBulgaria (+359)\nBurkina Faso (+226)\nBurundi (+257)\nCambodia (+855)\nCameroon (+237)\nCanada (+1)\nCape Verde Islands (+238)\nCayman Islands (+1345)\nCentral African Republic (+236)\nChile (+56)\nChina (+86)\nColombia (+57)\nComoros (+269)\nCongo (+242)\nCook Islands (+682)\nCosta Rica (+506)\nCroatia (+385)\nCuba (+53)\nCyprus North (+90392)\nCyprus South (+357)\nCzech Republic (+42)\nDenmark (+45)\nDjibouti (+253)\nDominica (+1809)\nDominican Republic (+1809)\nEcuador (+593)\nEgypt (+20)\nEl Salvador (+503)\nEquatorial Guinea (+240)\nEritrea (+291)\nEstonia (+372)\nEthiopia (+251)\nFalkland Islands (+500)\nFaroe Islands (+298)\nFiji (+679)\nFinland (+358)\nFrance (+33)\nFrench Guiana (+594)\nFrench Polynesia (+689)\nGabon (+241)\nGambia (+220)\nGeorgia (+7880)\nGermany (+49)\nGhana (+233)\nGibraltar (+350)\nGreece (+30)\nGreenland (+299)\nGrenada (+1473)\nGuadeloupe (+590)\nGuam (+671)\nGuatemala (+502)\nGuinea (+224)\nGuinea - Bissau (+245)\nGuyana (+592)\nHaiti (+509)\nHonduras (+504)\nHong Kong (+852)\nHungary (+36)\nIceland (+354)\nIndia (+91)\nIndonesia (+62)\nIran (+98)\nIraq (+964)\nIreland (+353)\nIsrael (+972)\nItaly (+39)\nJamaica (+1876)\nJapan (+81)\nJordan (+962)\nKazakhstan (+7)\nKenya (+254)\nKiribati (+686)\nKorea North (+850)\nKorea South (+82)\nKuwait (+965)\nKyrgyzstan (+996)\nLaos (+856)\nLatvia (+371)\nLebanon (+961)\nLesotho (+266)\nLiberia (+231)\nLibya (+218)\nLiechtenstein (+417)\nLithuania (+370)\nLuxembourg (+352)\nMacao (+853)\nMacedonia (+389)\nMadagascar (+261)\nMalawi (+265)\nMalaysia (+60)\nMaldives (+960)\nMa"]

      "newText": "# EndoSoft, LLC — Product Research\n\nResearched: 2025-07-14\nDeveloper website: https://www.endosoft.com/\n\n## Overview\n\nEndoSoft, LLC is a privately held health IT company headquartered in Schenectady, New York, founded in 1995 by brothers Rakesh Madan and Manish Madan. The company specializes in **endoscopy-focused EHR and procedure documentation software**, primarily serving gastroenterology and other procedural specialties. Their origin story is telling: they started by building software to capture endoscopic images and save them to a computer, eliminating paper printing. That image-capture-plus-procedure-documentation DNA still defines the product line.\n\nEndoSoft has an international presence with offices in the UK (Leicester), the Netherlands (Alphen aan den Rijn), India (Bangalore), Australia (Sydney), China (Suzhou, via Utech Biotechnology partner), Germany (Willich, via Utech Products GmbH), UAE (Abu Dhabi), and Canada (Laval, QC). This is a much larger global footprint than their low-profile US CHPL presence would suggest. They hold ISO 13485:2016 (medical device quality management) and ISO/IEC 27001 (information security) certifications, are HIMSS EHR Association members, and have Department of Defense / VA approvals for EndoVault. They serve hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), and practice-based endoscopy units. Testimonials reference McGill University (Canada), Queen Elizabeth Hospital (UK), and Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates.\n\nThe company has four products: **EndoVault** (their flagship on-premise EHR), **Qlinical** (a cloud-based EHR — the certified product here), **Argus AI** (AI-driven NLP procedure documentation), and **Approvon** (procedure order approval workflow, developed with NHS). Specialties served include gastroenterology, oncology, pulmonology, pain management, pathology, general surgery, orthopedics, OB/GYN, otolaryngology, and urology — though endoscopy/GI is clearly the core.\n\n## Product: Qlinical\n\nCHPL ID: 10855\nCHPL Product Number: 15.02.05.2721.QLIN.01.01.0.220310\nCertified: March 10, 2022\n\n### What It Is\n\nQlinical is EndoSoft's **cloud-based EHR** and procedure documentation system, positioned as the lighter-weight, lower-cost alternative to their flagship EndoVault product. The vendor describes it as \"ideal for small to medium sized practices with limited IT resources\" — a subscription-based SaaS offering with no server maintenance required. It runs on its own domain (qlinical.com) with a web login.\n\nQlinical is certified for a very minimal set of ONC criteria: only **(b)(10)** (EHI export) plus **(d)** security/privacy infrastructure criteria and **(g)(4)**/**(g)(5)** (quality management/accessibility). It has **no clinical criteria** [(a)(1)–(a)(14)], **no transitions of care** [(b)(1)–(b)(3)], **no patient portal** [(e)(1)], **no public health reporting** [(f)(1)–(f)(7)], and **no FHIR API** [(g)(7)–(g)(10)] certifications. This means the certified module is purely the EHI export function, not a broadly-certified EHR. Qlinical appears to function as a complete specialty EHR in practice but chose to certify only for the minimum required criteria.\n\n### Users & Market\n\nQlinical targets **small to medium procedural practices** — endoscopy units, GI practices, and other procedural specialties — that want cloud-based access without on-premise infrastructure. The product is marketed as a budget-friendly alternative to EndoVault (\"cutting edge workflow with cost savings embedded\"). The vendor advertises subscription-based pricing.\n\nThe qlinical.com site is a simple product site with a login portal, feature pages, and ONC certification disclosures. There is no publicly available customer count or case study for Qlinical specifically (the vendor testimonials on endosoft.com reference EndoVault, not Qlinical). Given the minimal marketing investment on the Qlinical site compared to EndoVault, Qlinical is likely a smaller product in terms of install base.\n\n### Modules & Functionality\n\nBased on the qlinical.com feature pages and the endosoft.com Qlinical product page, the product includes:\n\n**Consultation Module:**\n- Progress notes (chief complaints, history of present illness, recommendations)\n- History evaluation (indications for exam, allergies, patient history, medications, prior anesthesia complications)\n- Patient consent form generation (with tablet signature capture)\n- Referral letter generation (print or email)\n- Discharge summary (email or print)\n- Image management within consultation\n\n**Imaging Module:**\n- HD image and video capture from endoscopy equipment\n- One-click capture\n- Diagram/annotation tools (label image locations on built-in anatomical diagrams)\n- Image findings and notes\n\n**Procedure Documentation Module:**\n- Procedure report generation (PDF output)\n- Quality of care indicators input\n- Custom picklists for common procedures\n- Image management within procedure reports\n- Direct email of reports to patients\n\n**Electronic Nursing Record (ENR):**\n- Listed as a separate module on the endosoft.com Qlinical page\n- Nursing history: pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and post-procedure\n- Medication reconciliation\n- Automatic vital signs recording\n- Patient tracking\n- Nursing discharge evaluation\n- \"Proprietary Documentation & Quality Reporting Compliance\"\n\n**Scheduling:**\n- Cloud-based appointment scheduling\n- Custom alerts\n\n**Invoicing:**\n- Listed as a navigation item on qlinical.com\n- The consultation page mentions \"Create your invoice with a click of a button!\"\n- However, the invoicing page itself shows imaging/procedure content instead (appears to be a broken or placeholder page)\n- Nature and depth of invoicing/billing capabilities is unclear from available materials\n\n**AI Integration:**\n- Argus AI is described as \"embedded in Qlinical\" on the endosoft.com product page\n- This would add voice-activated NLP procedure documentation and automated quality metric capture\n- MedGPT generative AI chart review may also be available\n\n**E-Prescribing:**\n- Listed as a feature on the endosoft.com Qlinical page (\"E-Prescriptions\")\n\n### Data & Content\n\nBased on what the product pages describe, Qlinical stores:\n\n**Clinical Data:**\n- Patient demographics and history\n- Allergies\n- Medications and medication reconciliation\n- Vital signs (including automatic capture from devices)\n- Patient consent forms (with electronic signatures)\n- Progress notes / consultation notes\n- History of present illness, chief complaints\n- Indications for exams\n- Prior anesthesia complications\n\n**Procedure Data (core strength):**\n- Complete procedure reports\n- Procedure findings\n- Quality of care indicators / quality metrics\n- Diagnoses\n- Recommendations\n\n**Imaging/Media:**\n- HD endoscopic images\n- Endoscopic video\n- Image annotations and diagrams\n- Image-to-location mappings on anatomical diagrams\n\n**Nursing Records:**\n- Pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and post-procedure nursing documentation\n- Patient tracking data\n- Discharge evaluations\n\n**Administrative/Other:**\n- Appointment scheduling data\n- Referral letters\n- Discharge summaries\n- Invoicing data (though scope is unclear)\n- Prescriptions (e-prescribing mentioned)\n\n**EHI Export Page (qlinical.com/ephi/)** lists these exportable data sections: Allergies, Encounter, Immunizations, Medications, Plan of treatment, Referral reason, Active problems, Reason for visit, Implants, Health concerns, Procedures, Functional status, Results, Social history, Vitals, Goals, Discharge instructions, Assessments, Cognitive status, Media, Diagnostic Report, Documents, Service Request. Export is available as C-CDA XML or FHIR bulk export (ndjson). This list suggests Qlinical stores a broader set of clinical data than the marketing pages explicitly describe — notably immunizations, implants, functional/cognitive status, social history, goals, and results appear in the export but are not prominently marketed.\n\n**Notable gaps/uncertainties:**\n- The website does not clearly describe billing or claims functionality — \"invoicing\" is mentioned but the invoicing page appears broken/misloaded, and it's unclear whether this is simple charge capture, invoice generation, or full claims management\n- No mention of lab ordering or results interfaces (though \"Results\" appears in the EHI export list)\n- No mention of patient portal or patient-facing features (consistent with no (e)(1) certification)\n- No mention of CPOE beyond what EndoVault offers\n- No mention of HL7/FHIR interoperability with hospital EHRs for Qlinical specifically (EndoVault features page discusses HL7 interfaces, but it's unclear if Qlinical has the same)\n- Inventory management is listed as an EndoVault ENR feature but not mentioned for Qlinical's ENR\n\n### Relationship to EndoVault\n\nQlinical appears to be a cloud-native re-implementation or cloud-hosted version of EndoSoft's core endoscopy documentation capabilities, stripped down for smaller practices. EndoVault is the full-featured, on-premise product with patient portal, CPOE, PACS integration, DICOM viewer, inventory management, and extensive HL7/FHIR interfaces. Qlinical offers the core procedure documentation and image capture workflow in a simpler cloud package. They are separate products with separate websites, separate CHPL certifications, and different target markets — but built by the same company with shared DNA. Argus AI is embedded in both.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- EndoSoft's website is heavy on marketing but many pages redirect to the homepage (disclosure/cost, specialty pages, Argus page all redirected). The actual feature detail is spread across endosoft.com and qlinical.com.\n- No third-party reviews were found for Qlinical specifically on G2, Capterra, or KLAS. EndoSoft/EndoVault may have reviews but they were not accessible during this research.\n- The mandatory_disclosures_url field in CHPL metadata is empty, which is unusual. The qlinical.com site references \"Qlinical EHR Disclosures\" but that link also redirects to the homepage.\n- The company's international footprint (UK, Netherlands, India, Australia, China, Germany, UAE, Canada) suggests a much larger operation than a typical small US EHR vendor, though much of the international business may be EndoVault-focused and UK/NHS-oriented.\n"

Done. Here's a summary of what I found:

**EndoSoft, LLC** is a specialty endoscopy EHR vendor founded in 1995 in Schenectady, NY with surprisingly broad international operations (UK, Netherlands, India, Australia, China, Germany, UAE, Canada).

**Qlinical** is their cloud-based EHR for small-to-medium procedural practices — the budget SaaS sibling of their flagship on-premise product EndoVault. Key characteristics:

- **Core purpose**: Endoscopy procedure documentation + image/video capture, from consent to discharge
- **Specialties**: GI, oncology, pulmonology, pain management, general surgery, orthopedics, OB/GYN, otolaryngology, urology, pathology
- **Modules**: Consultation, imaging, procedure documentation, electronic nursing record (ENR), scheduling, e-prescribing, invoicing (unclear depth), with Argus AI embedded
- **Minimal ONC certification**: Only (b)(10) EHI export + (d) security + (g)(4)/(g)(5) — no clinical criteria, no patient portal, no FHIR APIs, no public health reporting
- **EHI export** lists 23 data categories (some broader than what marketing highlights — immunizations, implants, cognitive/functional status, social history, goals)
- **Notable gaps**: No third-party reviews found; invoicing page appears broken; mandatory disclosures URL is empty in CHPL metadata; many endosoft.com pages redirect to homepage
