        "description": "Minerva is a FHIR-based Healthcare Data Platform-as-a-Service, originally built by mphrX (founded 2011) and acquired by agilon health in February 2023 for $45M. It is NOT a traditional EHR — it is an interoperability and data aggregation middleware platform. Minerva aggregates clinical data from disparate EHR systems (Epic, Cerner, athenahealth, etc.) into a unified, vendor-neutral FHIR repository, creating a longitudinal patient record. It provides SMART on FHIR and Bulk FHIR APIs for programmatic access. The broader Minerva platform includes a white-labeled 'Digital Front Door' patient portal with appointment booking and notifications, surgery coordination with OR scheduling, virtual care/telehealth, and care pathway management. agilon health itself is a value-based care enablement company (NYSE: AGL) that partners with independent primary care physician groups serving Medicare populations. agilon's physician partners use their own EHRs for clinical documentation; Minerva serves as a data aggregation layer. The certified module covers Minerva's ability to store health data in FHIR format and expose it through standardized APIs and bulk export. It does not certify clinical workflow capabilities. Minerva integrates with billing gateways but is not a native billing system. It does not generate clinical documentation — it aggregates it from source systems.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "Minerva exports EHI as FHIR R4 NDJSON files via two mechanisms: (1) Single patient export from the Minerva portal UI — a Clinical Admin selects a patient, clicks 'Export EHI,' and receives a ZIP file containing one NDJSON file per FHIR resource type plus a readme.txt; (2) Bulk export via FHIR Bulk Data Access API (Patient/$export) using SMART Backend Services Authorization (client credentials with signed JWT). The bulk API is async — client polls a Content-Location URL for status, then downloads NDJSON files when complete. Files are split at 10,000 records per file. This is a pure FHIR resource export, not a native database dump. The export is limited to 21 FHIR resource types. Because Minerva is a data aggregation platform rather than a source EHR, the exported data is whatever was ingested from upstream source systems and mapped to these FHIR resources. This approach adds little beyond what the FHIR API itself provides — it is essentially the same data in bulk file form rather than API access.",

Given that Minerva is a data aggregation platform (not a source EHR), the export is inherently limited to what was ingested from upstream systems and mapped to FHIR resources. The broader Minerva platform includes patient portal capabilities (appointment booking, notifications), surgery coordination, and billing gateway integrations, but data from these features is absent from the export. The export essentially repackages FHIR API data as NDJSON files, adding little beyond what the standardized FHIR API (g)(10) already provides. For a platform that sits atop source EHRs, the more critical EHI exports would come from those source systems, not from this aggregation layer.",

  "summary": "agilon health's Minerva product (originally built by mphrX, acquired 2023) is a FHIR-based data aggregation platform — not a source EHR. Its EHI export provides 21 FHIR R4 resource types as NDJSON files, covering standard clinical data but omitting billing, insurance, scheduling, and messaging. The 12-page documentation is purely procedural (how to trigger the export) with no data dictionary. It is outdated (v1.0, copyright 2021, mphrX-branded) and has not been updated post-acquisition. The export essentially repackages the same data available through the FHIR API, adding minimal value beyond what (g)(10) already provides.",

  "notes": "The mphrX/agilon health relationship is important context: mphrX was an independent health IT company that built Minerva and obtained ONC certification in 2021. agilon health (a value-based care services company, not traditionally a health IT vendor) acquired mphrX in February 2023 for $45M to integrate Minerva's data aggregation capabilities into its enterprise platform. The EHI documentation still reflects the pre-acquisition state entirely. The fundamental nature of Minerva as an aggregation layer (not a source system) makes the b(10) completeness question somewhat different from a traditional EHR — the 'product' stores aggregated FHIR data from other systems, so its export is inherently a derivative of upstream source data rather than original clinical records."
