    "Documentation does not include data types for fields — only field name lists",
    "No value sets or code enumerations provided",

  "summary": "Bizmatics provides a single 26-page PDF documenting 47 data element categories exportable from PrognoCIS. The export produces a ZIP containing XLS/TXT files for structured data and PDFs for documents, organized in patient-specific folders. Coverage is comprehensive: clinical data, messages, billing/claims (very detailed), insurance, appointments, and documents are all included with field-level listings. However, the documentation lacks data types, value sets, and schema definitions — it provides only field name lists in prose format. Patient population export requires vendor assistance rather than self-service."
