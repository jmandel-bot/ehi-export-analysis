        "description": "Total Outcomes Management (TOM) is a population health analytics and quality reporting platform — NOT an EHR. It functions as a clinical data warehouse that ingests data from 50+ EMRs via configurable connectors, plus claims data, Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data, and ADT feeds. TOM normalizes this data at the patient level for quality measure calculation and value-based care analytics. ReportingMD is a CMS-designated Qualified Registry for MIPS reporting. The product serves ACOs (e.g., Tufts Medicine ACO, Vermont All-Payer ACO), clinically integrated networks, medical groups, and specialty practices. TOM supports programs including ACO REACH, MIPS, MSSP, HCC Risk Adjustment, HEDIS/STARS Analytics, and APCM. The certified criteria confirm TOM is not a clinical system: it lacks all (a)(1)-(a)(14) clinical criteria, has no patient portal (e)(1), no public health reporting (f)(1)-(f)(7), and no FHIR API (g)(7)-(g)(10). The certification covers only EHI export (b)(10), CQM calculation (c)(2)-(c)(3), security (d) criteria, and QMS (g)(4)-(g)(5)).",

        "description": "The export is a simple Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheet containing only patient demographic data. For a single patient, data appears in one row; for a population export, data appears in multiple rows. This is effectively a patient matching roster dump — the demographic identifiers TOM stores for linking patients across disparate data sources. It is not a database dump, not FHIR, and not C-CDA. The export contains zero clinical content, zero quality measure results, zero claims data, and zero analytics output. The data element list (24 columns, only 11 actually populated) appears modeled on HIPAA's 18 identifier categories rather than on TOM's actual data model.",

This is a patient matching roster, not a comprehensive EHI export. TOM stores substantial data beyond demographics: it ingests and normalizes clinical data from 50+ EMRs, processes adjudicated claims data, stores SDoH data, computes 40+ clinical quality measures, calculates HCC risk scores, and generates HEDIS/STARS analytics. None of this stored data appears in the export. While TOM is not an EHR and some categories (messaging, scheduling, document management) are genuinely not applicable, the system's core function — aggregating and analyzing health data — produces and stores health information that is absent from the export. The quality measure results, risk scores, and aggregated clinical data warehouse contents are all arguably EHI under the b(10) requirement.",

  "summary": "ReportingMD's Total Outcomes Management (TOM) is a population health analytics and quality reporting platform — not an EHR. It aggregates clinical and claims data from 50+ EMRs for CQM calculation, HCC risk adjustment, and value-based care analytics. Despite storing substantial health data, its EHI export is remarkably minimal: a single Excel spreadsheet containing only 11 patient demographic fields (ID, name, DOB, gender, address, city, ZIP, date of death, phone, email, SSN). The single-page export specification is modeled on HIPAA identifiers rather than on the system's actual data contents, leaving the clinical data warehouse, quality measure results, risk scores, and claims data entirely unrepresented in the export.",

  "notes": "TOM's certification profile is unusual — it holds only (b)(10) EHI export, (c)(2)-(c)(3) CQM, (d) security, and (g)(4)-(g)(5) QMS criteria, with no clinical (a), patient access (e), public health (f), or API (g)(7)-(g)(10) criteria. This narrow certification footprint reflects TOM's role as a secondary analytics system rather than a primary clinical system. The key compliance question is whether TOM's aggregated/derived data (quality measure scores, risk calculations, normalized clinical warehouse contents) constitutes 'EHI that can be stored at the time of certification by the product' — if so, the export is substantially incomplete."
