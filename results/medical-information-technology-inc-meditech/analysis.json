  "summary": "MEDITECH documents EHI export across four platforms (Expanse, 6.x, Client/Server, MAGIC) using two fundamentally different configurations. Configuration 1 (Expanse, 6.15) uses a document-centric hybrid of scanned images, FHIR R4 bundle, C-CDA, and text/PDF supplemental reports — less structured and less machine-readable. Configuration 2 (C/S, MAGIC, 6.08 Ambulatory) uses structured CSV tables approaching a native database dump, with 384–923 field/table identifiers. The modern Expanse platform paradoxically has the least structured export, while the oldest platforms (C/S, MAGIC) have the most comprehensive coverage. Audit trails are absent across all platforms. Secure messages have varying coverage — absent in Expanse, present but limited in legacy platforms.",

  "notes": "The 'Regulatory EHI Export Functionality Guides' at customer.meditech.com require SAML authentication and are not publicly accessible. All three PDF data dictionaries are dated October 2023, which is notably old. The CHPL IDs list also includes 18 ancillary certifications (Cancer Case Reporting, Public Health Interfaces, Syndromic Surveillance, CCD Interfaces, Electronic Case Reporting) that are not EHR products and share the same export documentation URL. The CCD/Public Health interface modules do not have their own EHI export — they are part of the broader platform exports."
