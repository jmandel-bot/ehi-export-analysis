  "notes": "TruBridge also has two other certified products (CHBase™ and InstantPHR®) not included in the CHPL IDs for this research, but relevant to the ecosystem: CHBase is an interoperability/data exchange platform; InstantPHR is a patient portal that works with TruBridge EHR, Meditech, and athenaOne. TruBridge offers extensive RCM outsourcing services—it is unclear whether billing/claims data is stored in the certified EHR or in separate RCM systems. Primary market is rural and community hospitals with 45+ years of experience in this segment."
