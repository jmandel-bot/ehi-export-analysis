        "description": "iTRUST is a cloud-based, all-in-one practice management, EHR, and optical point-of-sale platform built specifically for eye care providers (optometry and ophthalmology). The product encompasses a far broader scope than its narrow ONC certification suggests — it is only certified for (a)(12) Family Health History, (a)(15) Social/Psychological/Behavioral Factors, and (b)(10) EHI Export, plus safety/security (d) criteria. However, the product itself includes a full EHR with exam templates, optical POS with frame/lens inventory, claims and billing with EDI clearinghouse, e-prescribing, patient scheduling with online booking, 2-way text messaging (SMS/WhatsApp), telemedicine with video recording, integrated patient payments, VoIP phone system with call logging, AI doctor assistant, automated recall/reminders, marketing blast campaigns, and practice analytics dashboards. The certified module IS the whole product — there is no separate module name — but the certification covers only a tiny fraction of the product's data-generating capabilities. Based in Miami, FL, serving independent optometry practices, ophthalmology clinics, optical retail stores, multi-location enterprise groups, and colleges.",

        "description": "iTRUST uses a native JSON export that produces a single JSON object per patient. The export is documented as an OpenAPI 3.0.1 schema with 35 schema objects and 279 total fields. The format is proprietary — neither FHIR nor C-CDA — mapping to iTRUST's internal data model. The export endpoint is 'patient/export' (POST) returning application/json. Single patient export is self-service via the Admin module; population export requires contacting customer support. The schema is well-structured but compact relative to the product's breadth — 35 schemas for a system with EHR, POS, billing, scheduling, messaging, telemedicine, and document management capabilities suggests significant data categories are not being exported.",

Insurance data is basic but present. However, there are significant gaps when compared to the product's full capabilities. The product has extensive scheduling (online booking, recall, surgical calendars), patient communications (2-way SMS/WhatsApp, VoIP with call logging, AI receptionist), telemedicine with video recording, optical POS with retail transactions, document/image management, and e-prescribing — none of which appear in the export schema. For a product that markets itself as an 'all-in-one' platform with 16+ modules, exporting only 35 schema objects covering primarily clinical encounters and billing is a notable underrepresentation of the data the system stores.",

The product explicitly offers '2-Way Text Messaging' (HIPAA-compliant SMS and WhatsApp), VoIP phone system with call logging and voicemail transcription, AI Receptionist interaction records, and automated recall/reminder communications. All of this communication data is absent from the export. The Statement schema has a 'message' field but this is a billing statement message, not patient-provider communication."

Payment schema with date, method, amount. Claim schema with claimDate, submitDate, submitMethod, externalMessage, statusMessages. Statement schema with printDate, dueDate, statementBalance.

The product has extensive scheduling capabilities: online patient booking with 24/7 self-service, real-time calendar synchronization, color-coded exam schedules, automated recall scheduling based on diagnosis history, surgical calendar management, telemedicine scheduling, pre-visit insurance verification at booking, and deposit collection.

        "Significant data gaps relative to product capabilities: the product has 16+ modules (scheduling, messaging, telemedicine, optical POS, document management, e-prescribing, VoIP, AI assistant) but the export schema covers primarily clinical encounters and billing. Scheduling, patient communications, telemedicine recordings, diagnostic images, optical retail data, and documents are all absent.",
        "Population export requires contacting customer support rather than being available self-service, which may not meet the b(10) requirement for readily available export functionality.",
        "No dedicated prescription/medication schema despite the product having e-prescribing (ERX) capability. Medication data may be partially captured via MedicalOrder but medication lists, prescription history, and pharmacy information are not explicitly represented.",
        "Optical POS retail transaction data (frame/lens sales, inventory, purchase profiles) is not included in the export despite being a core product module.",
        "Documentation is extremely minimal — three sentences on the b10 page plus a raw OpenAPI schema with no narrative, examples, process documentation, or export instructions.",
        "No documentation version, last-updated date, or information about what iTRUST version the schema corresponds to."

      "summary": "iTRUST is a comprehensive all-in-one eye care platform (EHR, POS, billing, scheduling, messaging, telemedicine) that exports patient data as native JSON with an OpenAPI 3.0.1 schema. The export covers clinical and billing data well — including eye-care-specific refractions and detailed invoice line items with dollar amounts — but is missing multiple significant data categories including scheduling, patient communications (SMS/WhatsApp), telemedicine recordings, diagnostic images, optical retail transactions, and documents. For a product with 16+ modules, the 35-schema export represents a notable underrepresentation of stored EHI."

  "summary": "iTRUST is a specialty eye care (optometry/ophthalmology) all-in-one cloud platform with 16+ modules including EHR, optical POS, billing, scheduling, messaging, telemedicine, and more. Their EHI export documentation is minimal but accessible — a 3-sentence b10 page linking to an OpenAPI 3.0.1 JSON schema with 35 schemas and 279 fields. The export covers clinical data (with eye-care-specific refractions) and billing (with actual dollar amounts) well, but is missing scheduling, patient communications, telemedicine recordings, diagnostic images, optical retail transactions, and documents — all capabilities the product clearly provides. Population export requires contacting customer support.",

  "notes": "The URL /7954-2 for the data dictionary appears to be an internal CMS page ID rather than a descriptive path. The product's ONC certification is very narrow (only criteria a12, a15, b10, d-series, g4-g5) despite the product being a comprehensive practice management platform — this suggests the certification was obtained with minimal scope while the product itself stores far more data than what's documented for export. The certified criteria do not include any API access criteria (g7-g10), patient portal criteria (e1), or public health reporting criteria (f-series), which is unusual for a product with this breadth of capabilities."
