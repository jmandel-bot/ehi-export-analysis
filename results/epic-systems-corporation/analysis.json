        "description": "Epic is the dominant EHR vendor in the US, powering approximately 38% of the hospital market and a larger share by patient lives covered. The five certified modules (EpicCare Ambulatory Base, EpicCare Inpatient Base, Beaker Reportable Labs Reporting, Beacon Cancer Registry Reporting, Infection Control Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Reporting) are components of the broader Epic EHR platform. Epic is a fully integrated system — not modular best-of-breed. A typical Epic installation includes: EpicCare (ambulatory + inpatient clinical), MyChart (patient portal with messaging and bill pay), Cadence (scheduling), Resolute (professional and hospital billing/revenue cycle), Beaker (laboratory), Radiant (radiology), Beacon (oncology), OpTime (surgical/perioperative), Prelude (registration/ADT), Grand Central (bed management), Tapestry (managed care), Healthy Planet (population health), and more. All modules share a single integrated database.",

      "export_approach": {
        "description": "Epic's EHI export is a native database dump — the gold standard approach. The export provides 7,672 tables/views from Epic's Clarity reporting database (the relational layer over their Chronicles operational database) as tab-separated value (TSV) files. This is not a FHIR export or C-CDA generation — it is the actual database schema with all stored data. Epic additionally created 89 purpose-built V_EHI_* views specifically for the EHI export, supplementing existing Clarity tables with audit trails, billing details, flowsheet measurements, and coverage history. Non-tabular data (rich text documents, images) are referenced from the tables and provided as a separate binary download.",
