The certified modules (EpicCare Ambulatory Base, EpicCare Inpatient Base, Beacon, Beaker, Infection Control) are components of the broader Epic EHR platform, which includes comprehensive clinical documentation (ambulatory and inpatient), patient portal messaging (MyChart), professional and hospital billing (Resolute), appointment scheduling (Cadence), laboratory (Beaker), radiology (Radiant), oncology (Beacon), surgery (OpTime), behavioral health (Wisdom), population health (Healthy Planet), and payer/insurance management (Tapestry). All modules share a common database, which is what the EHI export dumps. The export documentation covers tables from across all modules, not just the certified components.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Epic's EHI export is a native database dump of their internal Clarity/Caboodle reporting database tables in tab-separated value (TSV) format. This is the gold standard approach for EHI export: the database inherently contains everything the system stores, and the export is a direct dump of those tables. The documentation describes 7,672 individual database tables with a total of 63,121 columns across all tables. Rich text documents, images, and other non-tabular content are referenced from the TSV tables but exported as separate files in a companion download. The export is described as a 'manual one-time export of health data for one or more patients' — it is patient-scoped and health-system-initiated. Epic notes that actual content varies by health system based on which Epic applications are in use, software version, documentation practices, and configuration.",

Column descriptions often reference relationships to other tables implicitly (e.g., 'The unique ID assigned to the patient record') though explicit foreign key declarations are not present.

With 7,672 tables and 63,121 columns dumped directly from the native database, this is a true database-level export that captures everything the system stores. Clinical data is exhaustively covered across ambulatory, inpatient, lab, radiology, oncology, and specialty modules.

    "Epic notes that export content varies by health system based on which applications are in use, software version, documentation practices, and configuration, meaning the 7,672-table schema represents a superset — any given health system's export may include fewer tables.",
    "While relationships between tables are implicitly described in column descriptions, there are no explicit foreign key declarations, which could make it challenging to reconstruct complex data relationships without Epic domain expertise.",
    "Value sets and code enumerations are not documented — a consumer would need to infer meaning from the data values themselves or have access to Epic's reference data.",
    "No sample data is provided, making it harder to understand the practical structure of the TSV output without an actual export to reference."

  "summary": "Epic's EHI export is the gold standard for ONC b(10) compliance. It is a native database dump of 7,672 tables (63,121 total columns) in TSV format, covering all seven EHI categories comprehensively: clinical data across all specialties, MyChart patient portal messaging (82 tables), deep billing/claims (382+ claim tables, 51 professional billing tables), insurance/coverage/authorizations, scheduling/encounters (115 PAT_ENC tables), documents/images (including DICOM), and extensive audit trails (157+ audit tables). The documentation is publicly accessible, well-organized, auto-generated from metadata, and actively maintained (last updated February 2026). The only gaps are the absence of explicit foreign key documentation, value set definitions, and sample data.",

  "notes": "Epic's approach of dumping native database tables is fundamentally different from vendors who export FHIR resources or C-CDA documents. Because the export comes directly from Epic's Clarity/Caboodle reporting database, it inherently captures everything the system stores — there is no translation layer where data could be lost. The 7,672-table count is not inflated; these are real database tables with meaningful column-level documentation. The 'DocGen' prefix on the extraction directory suggests this documentation is automatically generated from Epic's internal metadata system, which explains both its comprehensiveness and its consistency. The February 2026 date indicates Epic regenerates this documentation with each software release."
