### Step 1: Probe the registered URL

```bash
curl -sI -L "https://allegiancemd.com/ehi-export-documentation" \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
```

Result: HTTP 200, `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`. WordPress page (PHP/8.2.18, Cloudflare CDN). No redirects.

### Step 2: Fetch and examine the page

```bash
curl -sL "https://allegiancemd.com/ehi-export-documentation" \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o /tmp/allegiancemd-ehi.html
```

The WordPress page uses the Divi Builder (`et_pb_*` shortcodes) which renders via JavaScript. The WP JSON API at `https://allegiancemd.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/4912` provided the rendered content directly. Page content (37 KB HTML, mostly Divi boilerplate with ~2.4 KB of actual content).

The page says:

> **EHI Export Documentation**
>
> **Introduction**
>
> Data is exported in [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) format (Concise Binary Object Representation) RFC 8949. The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is an open data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. It offers best result and avoid formatting issues that can exist in JSON.

> Please refer to https://cbor.io/impls.html for opensource tools and examples for the creation of quick scripts.
>
> [Please click here](https://allegiancemd.com/ehi-export/) to see detailed data structure of the objects. Documents and Clinical data will be included in the zip file. Each document has the corresponding .meta file that describes each document.

### Step 3: Follow the data structure link

```bash
curl -sL "https://allegiancemd.com/ehi-export/" \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -o /tmp/allegiancemd-ehi-export.html
```

Result: HTTP 200, `Content-Type: text/html`. This is a **Javadoc-generated data dictionary** (generated by javadoc/PackageWriterImpl on 2023-10-25). It lists 31 Java entity classes representing the data objects in the export. Each entity links to a detail page showing field names, data types, and (sometimes) descriptions.

### Step 4: Download all 31 entity detail pages

Downloaded all entity HTML pages from `https://allegiancemd.com/ehi-export/{EntityName}.html` plus the index page and stylesheet. Also extracted a structured JSON data dictionary from all pages.

## What Was Found

### Export Format

AllegianceMD exports EHI data in **CBOR format** (Concise Binary Object Representation, RFC 8949). This is unusual — CBOR is a binary serialization format designed for small message size and extensibility, commonly used in IoT/constrained environments. It's semantically similar to JSON but in a compact binary encoding.

The export is delivered as a **ZIP file** containing:
- CBOR-encoded data objects (one per entity type, presumably)
- Documents and clinical data files
- `.meta` files describing each document

The vendor points to https://cbor.io/impls.html for open-source tools to read the format.

### Data Dictionary (Javadoc)

The data structure documentation at `/ehi-export/` is a Javadoc site generated from the Java entity classes that define the export schema. It documents **31 entity types** with a total of **715 fields**.

The 31 entities are:

| Entity | Fields | Description Coverage |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| PatientEntity | 71 | 100% — every field described |
| CasesEntity | 41 | 100% — every field described |
| InsuranceDataEntity | 36 | 100% — every field described |
| InsuranceDataAuthorizationsEntity | 9 | 100% — every field described |
| EmrMedicationEntity | 62 | ~2% (1 field described) |
| EmrPatientOrderPanelEntity | 60 | ~2% (1 field described) |
| TransactionsEntity | 53 | 0% — no descriptions |
| EncountersEntity | 47 | ~4% (2 fields described) |
| EmrInjectionEntity | 43 | 0% |
| AppointmentsEntity | 25 | 0% |
| GuarantorEntity | 24 | 0% |
| ScreeningEntity | 23 | ~4% (1 field described) |
| MessagesEntity | 21 | ~5% (1 field described) |
| EmrImplantableDeviceEntity | 20 | 0% |
| EmrPatientOrderItemEntity | 20 | 0% |
| PatientCareTeamEntity | 19 | 0% |
| EmrAllergyEntity | 18 | 0% |
| EmrRefToProvidersEntity | 18 | ~6% (1 field described) |
| TasksEntity | 18 | 0% |
| EmrProblemEntity | 16 | 0% |
| PaymentEntity | 12 | 0% |
| PatientMedicalFormEntity | 11 | 0% |
| EmrVitalsCategoryEntity | 11 | 0% |
| PatientPharmacyEntity | 10 | 0% |
| EmrVitalsEntity | 7 | 0% |
| InternalNotesEntity | 6 | 0% |
| TaskCommentsEntity | 4 | 0% |
| PatientCustomFieldsEntity | 3 | 0% |
| EncountersDiagEntity | 3 | 0% |
| NotesEntity | 2 | 0% |
| EmrEncounterEntity | 2 | 0% |

**Overall: 164 of 715 fields (23%) have descriptions.** Only 4 entities (PatientEntity, CasesEntity, InsuranceDataEntity, InsuranceDataAuthorizationsEntity) have complete descriptions. The remaining 27 entities provide only field names and Java data types, with no descriptions of what the fields contain.

Each field listing shows:
- **Data type**: Java types (String, Integer, Boolean, Date, Double, Long, List<EntityType>)
- **Field name**: camelCase Java field names (e.g., `birthFname`, `addressActiveDate`, `cpt`, `diag1`)
- **Description**: Present for ~23% of fields; when present, descriptions are brief but helpful (e.g., "Patient Account", "Patient address active date")

### Data Architecture

The export is **patient-centric**: the `PatientEntity` is the root object, with `List<>` fields that embed related entities. For example, `PatientEntity` has:
- `allergyList: List<EmrAllergyEntity>` — Patient allergy list
- `appointmentsEntityList: List<AppointmentsEntity>` — Patient appointments
- `caseList: List<CasesEntity>` — Patient case list
- `encountersList: List<EncountersEntity>` — Patient encounters
- `insuranceDataList: List<InsuranceDataEntity>` — Patient insurance data
- `medicationList: List<EmrMedicationEntity>` — Patient medication list
- `problemList: List<EmrProblemEntity>` — Patient problem list
- `vitalsList: List<EmrVitalsEntity>` — Patient vitals
- `transactionsList: List<TransactionsEntity>` — Patient transactions (billing)
- And more

This is a hierarchical, denormalized structure — each patient export contains all their data nested within a single object graph. Relationships between entities are expressed through these list embeddings rather than foreign keys.

## Export Coverage Assessment

### Data Domain Coverage

**Domains clearly covered by the export:**
- **Patient demographics** — PatientEntity has 71 fields covering name, address, DOB, phone, email, SSN, race, ethnicity, language, marital status, employment, emergency contacts, preferred pharmacy
- **Clinical encounters** — EncountersEntity (47 fields), EmrEncounterEntity (2 fields)
- **Diagnoses** — EncountersDiagEntity (3 fields — diagnosis code linkage to encounters)
- **Problems** — EmrProblemEntity (16 fields)
- **Medications** — EmrMedicationEntity (62 fields — very detailed including e-prescribing fields)
- **Allergies** — EmrAllergyEntity (18 fields)
- **Vitals** — EmrVitalsEntity (7 fields), EmrVitalsCategoryEntity (11 fields)
- **Injections/Immunizations** — EmrInjectionEntity (43 fields)
- **Implantable devices** — EmrImplantableDeviceEntity (20 fields)
- **Lab/imaging orders** — EmrPatientOrderItemEntity (20 fields), EmrPatientOrderPanelEntity (60 fields)
- **Insurance data** — InsuranceDataEntity (36 fields), InsuranceDataAuthorizationsEntity (9 fields)
- **Billing transactions** — TransactionsEntity (53 fields — includes CPT, diagnosis codes, amounts, balance)
- **Payments** — PaymentEntity (12 fields)
- **Appointments** — AppointmentsEntity (25 fields)
- **Cases** — CasesEntity (41 fields — workers' comp, etc.)
- **Guarantor** — GuarantorEntity (24 fields)
- **Care team** — PatientCareTeamEntity (19 fields)
- **Referrals** — EmrRefToProvidersEntity (18 fields)
- **Messages** — MessagesEntity (21 fields)
- **Internal notes** — InternalNotesEntity (6 fields), NotesEntity (2 fields)
- **Tasks** — TasksEntity (18 fields), TaskCommentsEntity (4 fields)
- **Screenings** — ScreeningEntity (23 fields)
- **Custom fields** — PatientCustomFieldsEntity (3 fields)
- **Medical forms** — PatientMedicalFormEntity (11 fields)
- **Pharmacy** — PatientPharmacyEntity (10 fields)

**Domains likely missing or unclear:**
- **Documents/scanned files** — The intro page says "Documents and Clinical data will be included in the zip file" with `.meta` files, but there is no entity documenting the document metadata structure
- **Fax records** — The product supports unlimited faxing; no fax entity is present
- **E-prescribing history** — While EmrMedicationEntity has prescription-related fields, there's no separate prescription/Rx transaction entity
- **Audit logs** — No audit trail entity, though this is a common omission
- **Collection records** — The product has a collections module; no dedicated entity
- **Credit card/payment processing details** — PaymentEntity exists but with only 12 fields
- **Patient portal data** — Portal access logs, patient-entered data, portal messages
- **Quality/MIPS reporting data** — No quality measure entity
- **Appointment reminders** — No reminder entity
- **Eligibility verification results** — No eligibility entity
- **Claim submissions/rejections/denials** — TransactionsEntity covers charges but unclear if claim lifecycle is captured
- **EOBs/remittance advice** — Not clearly represented

### Export Format & Standards

The CBOR format is **unusual and vendor-specific**. This is:
- **Not a recognized health data standard** — not FHIR, C-CDA, HL7v2, or any healthcare interoperability format
- **Not human-readable** — requires CBOR decoding tools to inspect
- **Semantically equivalent to JSON** — CBOR maps 1:1 to JSON data types, so the choice of binary encoding over JSON is a size optimization, not a semantic one
- **Well-documented as a standard** (RFC 8949) with open-source implementations in most languages

The data model itself is a **direct serialization of Java entity classes** — the Javadoc is literally generated from the application's codebase. This means the export mirrors the internal data model, which is good for completeness but means field names use internal conventions (camelCase Java identifiers like `birthFname`, `addressActiveDate`, `cancelRequestApproved`) rather than standard terminology.

There are **no coded value sets documented**. Fields like `status`, `type`, `action` have String types but the allowed values are not specified. Similarly, diagnosis codes appear as bare strings (`diag1`, `diag2`... `diag12`) without indicating the coding system (ICD-10? SNOMED?).

This is **genuinely a (b)(10) export, not a repackaged (g)(10) FHIR API**. The export covers billing, insurance, internal notes, tasks, custom fields, guarantor information — data well beyond USCDI/US Core. The vendor built a real bulk export of their internal data model, which is the right approach for (b)(10).

### Documentation Quality

- **Readability**: The Javadoc format is navigable — entity index links to detail pages with field listings. However, the styling is minimal (standard Javadoc CSS) and there's no narrative explanation or user guide
- **Field-level definitions**: Present for only 23% of fields. The 4 fully-documented entities (Patient, Cases, InsuranceData, InsuranceDataAuthorizations) show what good documentation looks like — every field has a plain-English description. The other 27 entities have only field names and types
- **Data types**: Consistently documented using Java types (String, Integer, Boolean, Date, Double, Long). List<> types show relationships between entities
- **Value sets**: Not documented. No enumeration of allowed values for coded fields
- **Examples**: None provided — no sample export files, no example CBOR data
- **User guide**: None — no instructions for how to request or perform the export. The intro page mentions the ZIP format and .meta files but doesn't explain the workflow
- **Import feasibility**: A developer could parse the CBOR and reconstruct the entity hierarchy, but would need to guess at the meaning of ~77% of fields based on naming conventions alone. Field names are generally self-explanatory (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`, `dob`, `amount`) but some are cryptic (e.g., `pqrsQualDataCode`, `hcfa21_4`, `modifier1`)

### Structure & Completeness

- **Granularity**: Field-level documentation with types for all 715 fields; descriptions for 164 fields
- **Relationships**: Well-expressed through List<> type annotations on PatientEntity — the entity graph is clear
- **Versioning**: Generated 2023-10-25; no version history or changelog
- **Coded fields**: Not documented with value sets
- **Cardinality**: Implicit — List<> for one-to-many, scalar for one-to-one

### Overall Assessment

AllegianceMD has taken a **genuinely (b)(10)-oriented approach** — they export their internal data model in a structured binary format (CBOR) with a data dictionary derived from their Java entity classes. This is fundamentally the right idea: export everything the system stores, not just the USCDI/FHIR subset.

The export covers a broad range of data domains — clinical, billing, insurance, appointments, tasks, messages, and more — going well beyond what a FHIR API would provide. The 31 entities and 715 fields represent a substantial portion of the data an ambulatory EHR/PM system would store.

However, the documentation quality is inconsistent. Four entities are fully documented; 27 have only field names and types. The CBOR format, while well-specified as a standard, is unusual for healthcare data exchange and adds a decoding step. There are no sample files, no user guide, and no value set documentation. The documentation was generated once (October 2023) and appears to be a static snapshot rather than a maintained resource.

The missing document metadata schema (for the .meta files) is a notable gap — the intro page says documents are included but doesn't document their structure.

## Access Summary
- Final URL (after redirects): https://allegiancemd.com/ehi-export-documentation (no redirect)
- Status: found
- Required browser: no (curl works fine for all content)
- Navigation complexity: one_click (main page links to /ehi-export/ data structure)
- Anti-bot issues: none (Cloudflare present but not blocking)

## Obstacles & Dead Ends
- The main WordPress page uses the Divi page builder, so `sed`-based text extraction returned nothing. The WP JSON API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/4912`) cleanly provided the rendered content
- The Javadoc pages have `<META NAME="robots" CONTENT="noindex,nofollow">` tags, suggesting the vendor intended them to be hidden from search engines
- No PDF, ZIP, or downloadable archive of the documentation is provided — everything is HTML only
