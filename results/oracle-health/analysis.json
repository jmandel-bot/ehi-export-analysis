  "summary": "Oracle Health provides exceptionally comprehensive EHI export documentation covering two distinct product lines. The Millennium EHR export is a full SQL database dump (MySQL or Oracle DB) covering 6,604 tables across 242 data domains, with field-level documentation (column names, types, nullability, definitions) in 1,456 HTML report files. Four storage systems are documented: core relational DB, multimedia storage (DICOM/non-DICOM), document imaging, and longitudinal care plans. The HDI export uses JSON/Avro format with 124 entity types accessed via REST APIs. All major EHI categories are represented including clinical data, billing/charges, insurance, scheduling, secure messaging, documents/images, and audit trails (Prologue). This is a genuine database-level export, not a FHIR re-export — the data comes as-is from the Millennium production database schema."
