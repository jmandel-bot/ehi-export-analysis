        "overall_assessment": "Oracle Health Millennium's EHI export is among the most comprehensive in the industry. As a native database export of 6,604 tables across 242 schema modules, it covers effectively every data category stored by the platform. The export spans four separate storage systems (relational database, multimedia storage, document imaging, and care planning), ensuring that non-relational data like DICOM images, scanned documents, and care plans are also included. The billing/financial coverage is exceptionally deep with 145 PFT tables plus charge, claims, and revenue cycle schemas. Scheduling has 189 dedicated tables. Clinical data spans dozens of modules (pathology, radiology, surgery, pharmacy, etc.). Audit trails are well-represented with 65+ audit tables. The only minor gap is that patient portal secure messaging content tables are not clearly labeled in the data model, though they would be included if stored in the Millennium database. This is a textbook example of how EHI export should be done.",

        "Documentation complexity: The 6,604-table data model lacks a comprehensive mapping guide explaining which tables serve which clinical functions. A receiving system would need significant Cerner/Millennium domain expertise to interpret the data.",
        "Population export operational complexity: Single-tenant population exports require Oracle-licensed software for database restoration, customer-supplied encrypted hardware, and physical shipping — operationally complex compared to a simple file download.",
        "Legacy naming: URLs still reference 'cerner-corp-' and internal documentation uses 'Cerner Millennium' naming, suggesting documentation has not been fully updated post-acquisition.",

All seven EHI categories — clinical, messaging, billing, insurance, scheduling, documents, and audit — are substantively covered.

HDI uses an API-based export of Avro-schema JSON files with 124 entity types, which is supplementary to the Millennium database export. The HDI CHPL entries are not among our 10 target IDs, but the documentation was collected for completeness. Oracle's acquisition of Cerner (2022) means legacy naming persists throughout the documentation. The data model version is 2025.4.01, suggesting active maintenance."
