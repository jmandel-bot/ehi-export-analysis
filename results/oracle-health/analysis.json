    "description": "Oracle Health (formerly Cerner Corporation, acquired by Oracle in 2022) operates one of the largest EHR platforms in the world. The Millennium platform is a comprehensive enterprise health information system used by large hospital systems, academic medical centers, and community hospitals globally. The certified modules (Clinical, CQMs, Health Care Surveys, Immunizations, Patient Portal, PowerChart Touch) are components of the much broader Millennium platform, which includes full revenue cycle management (registration through collections), appointment scheduling, clinical documentation (PowerChart), pharmacy (PharmNet), lab (PathNet), radiology (RadNet), surgery (SurgiNet), nursing, oncology, behavioral health, women's health, rehabilitation, clinical trials, document imaging, multimedia storage, and more. The EHI export documentation explicitly covers the full Millennium database, not just the certified module scope, which is the correct approach under b(10). Additionally, Oracle Health Data Intelligence (HDI) is a separate cloud-based analytics platform that aggregates Millennium data into a longitudinal record; it has its own EHI export pathway via REST APIs.",

  "export_approach": {
    "description": "Oracle Health takes a native database export approach — the gold standard for EHI completeness. The Millennium platform export dumps the actual production database in SQL format (DDL schemas + INSERT statements), which can be loaded into either a MySQL or Oracle Database instance. For single-tenant (standalone) systems, the population export delivers a full copy of the Millennium database on a customer-supplied encrypted device. For multi-tenant (CommunityWorks/ASP) systems, the data is delivered via SQL files. The export covers four independent data storage locations: (1) Core Millennium EHR database (6,587 tables across 242+ domain categories), (2) Oracle Health Multimedia Storage (DICOM images in tar.gz with XML/JSON metadata, non-DICOM files in CSV-indexed archives), (3) Oracle Health Document Imaging (content management database with its own schema), and (4) Longitudinal Plan/One Plan data (JSON files via HealtheIntent). Additionally, Oracle Health Data Intelligence (HDI) provides a separate export pathway via REST APIs (Bulk Extract + Data Syndication) that delivers the HDI Longitudinal Record as JSON in tar.gz format with ~219 Avro-schema entity types. The single patient export produces ZIP files; the population export may use encrypted physical media for the database component.",

Foreign key relationships between tables are documented. The data model is versioned (2025.4.01, last updated January 16, 2025). The model is provided in both MySQL and Oracle Database variants. The overview PDFs provide clear instructions for consuming the export data, including SQL queries for cross-referencing multimedia files with the core EHR database. The HDI documentation provides Avro-schema entity type definitions with field names, types, and descriptions for approximately 219 entity types. The Document Imaging schema PDF documents the content management database tables with column-level detail. The only minor gap is that value sets/code sets are not fully enumerated in the documentation — the CODE_VALUE and CODE_SET tables serve as the internal code system, but the allowed values aren't pre-documented.

    "overall_assessment": "Oracle Health's EHI export is one of the most comprehensive in the industry, reflecting the depth of the Millennium platform. By exporting the actual production database (6,587 tables across 242 domain categories), the export inherently covers virtually all data the system stores. The export explicitly covers four data storage locations (core EHR database, multimedia storage, document imaging, and longitudinal plan data), leaving very little room for gaps. Clinical data is extensively covered across dozens of domain categories. Billing and revenue cycle data is deeply represented through the PFT (Patient Financial Transactions) suite with 145+ tables covering charges, claims, billing, posting, and account management. Insurance/authorization data is well-documented with dedicated health plan, benefit, and authorization tables. Scheduling has 191+ tables. Document imaging and multimedia storage have dedicated export pathways with their own schemas. The message center and messaging infrastructure tables are present, covering internal messaging. Audit tables (66 audit-related tables) are included. The only area where coverage is less clear is patient portal secure messaging — while portal invitation tables exist (PERSON_PORTAL_INVITE) and the messaging infrastructure is present (MSVC_MESSAGING domain with distribution lists, subscriptions, messaging audit), the traditional 'inbox message' between patient and provider via the portal is likely stored in these messaging tables but the mapping isn't immediately obvious from table names alone.

    "The patient population export for single-tenant systems requires a 'customer-supplied secure encrypted device' for physical delivery of the full database — this adds logistical complexity and cost to the export process.",
    "The HDI export requires API authentication (bearer token or OAuth 1.0a) and pre-enablement by Oracle Health, meaning it is not fully self-service without initial vendor coordination.",
    "Value sets and code tables (CODE_VALUE, CODE_SET) are not pre-documented in the data model reports — consumers must query the exported database to understand coded values, which adds complexity.",
    "The export documentation references external HealtheIntent API documentation (docs.healtheintent.com) for Longitudinal Plan data format specifications rather than including the schemas inline, creating a dependency on an external documentation source.",

  "summary": "Oracle Health provides one of the most comprehensive EHI export implementations in the industry. The Millennium platform export dumps the entire production database (6,587 tables across 242 domain categories) in SQL format loadable into MySQL or Oracle Database, plus dedicated export pathways for multimedia storage (DICOM and non-DICOM), document imaging, and longitudinal plan data. This native database approach inherently covers clinical, billing/revenue cycle (145+ PFT tables), insurance/authorization, scheduling (191+ tables), document management, messaging, and audit trails (66+ audit tables). The documentation is exceptionally detailed with field-level definitions, data types, nullability, and foreign key relationships for every table. The only notable concerns are logistical: population exports for single-tenant systems require physical encrypted media, the HDI export requires API pre-enablement, and code value sets must be self-discovered from the exported data rather than pre-documented.",

  "notes": "Oracle Health also provides a separate EHI export pathway for their Health Data Intelligence (HDI) cloud analytics platform, with its own documentation covering ~219 Avro-schema entity types exported as JSON. The HDI Longitudinal Record represents an aggregated view of patient data and covers claims, billing, appointments, insurance, and clinical data — but notably does not include messaging or audit trail entities (zero occurrences of 'message', 'inbox', 'portal', or 'audit' in the HDI specs). The Millennium database export is far more comprehensive than the HDI export. The data model version 2025.4.01 is very recent, suggesting active maintenance. The domain category listing (242 categories) reads like a comprehensive inventory of a modern enterprise health system: from 'ambulatory_care' to 'workforce', with deep coverage of specialty areas (oncology, behavioral_health, womens_health, rehabilitation, clinical_trials, blood_bank, hla). The SCM (Supply Chain Management) tables (scm_accounting, scm_contract, scm_item, scm_purchasing, scm_requisition, scm_transaction) suggest the export even covers supply chain/materials management data, which goes beyond what most vendors include."
