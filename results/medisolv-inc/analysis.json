        "description": "ENCOR-e is NOT a full EHR. It is a specialized clinical quality measure (eCQM) reporting and quality management platform. Medisolv describes it as 'Electronic Measures software designed to assist hospitals and clinicians in monitoring, improving and reporting their eCQMs to CMS and other regulatory bodies.' It is a secondary/downstream system that ingests a subset of clinical data from a customer's primary EHR (Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH, Allscripts, etc.) via nightly incremental data loads, computes quality measures, and reports results to CMS, The Joint Commission, and other regulatory bodies. It has no patient portal, no billing, no scheduling, no document management — only quality-measure-relevant clinical data elements. The CHPL certification confirms this: no (a)-series clinical data criteria, no (e)(1) patient portal, no (f)-series public health, no (g)(7)-(g)(10) FHIR APIs — only (b)(10) EHI export, (c)(1)-(c)(3) clinical quality measures, and (d)-series security/privacy criteria.",

        "description": "ENCOR-e exports EHI as QRDA-I (Quality Reporting Document Architecture - Category I) XML documents, an HL7 CDA R2 standard designed for quality measure reporting. Each document contains patient demographics, clinical data elements relevant to quality measures (diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab results), and encounter information. This is a standard-format export — not a native database dump. Single patient export is available via a UI button ('QRDA Export (Full Record)') on the patient detail page. Bulk export requires contacting a Medisolv Clinical Quality Advisor, who initiates the process and delivers via secure email or SFTP. The vendor provides no proprietary data dictionary — they defer entirely to the HL7 QRDA-I specification.",

        "overall_assessment": "ENCOR-e is a quality reporting tool, not a full EHR, so its data footprint is inherently limited to quality-measure-relevant clinical data elements. The QRDA-I export likely covers most of what the product stores (demographics, diagnoses, procedures, medications, labs, encounters), which is the correct scope for b(10) compliance — the requirement is 'all EHI stored by the product.' However, the product stores only a small fraction of what a full EHR would store. Non-clinical categories (billing, messaging, scheduling, documents) are absent because the product simply doesn't manage that data. The export is likely adequate for the product's narrow scope, but the QRDA-I format may not capture all internal data (e.g., abstracted chart data, quality measure calculation results, internal notes) that ENCOR-e stores beyond the standard QRDA-I data elements.",

  "notes": "ENCOR-e's certified criteria profile ((b)(10), (c)(1)-(c)(3), (d)-series, (g)(2)/(g)(4)/(g)(5) only) is a strong indicator that this is a quality reporting tool, not a clinical system. The absence of (a)-series, (e)-series, (f)-series, and (g)(7)-(g)(10) criteria confirms the product does not handle direct clinical data capture, patient portals, public health reporting, or FHIR API access. The QRDA-I export format is well-suited for quality measure data but may not capture all internal product data (abstracted measures, quality scores, performance analytics). The HL7 QRDA-I specification ZIP linked from the page (https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/dstu/CDAR2_IG_QRDA_I_R1_STU5.3_2021NOV_2022DEC_with_errata.zip) is a standard spec, not vendor-specific documentation."
